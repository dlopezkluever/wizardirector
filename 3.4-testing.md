## Step-by-Step Testing Guide

### Test 1: Clone Global Asset into Project

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to Stage 5 of a project
2. Ensure you have at least one global asset in your library (create one if needed)
3. Click "Browse Global Library" button
4. Asset drawer should slide out from bottom
5. Search or filter assets as needed
6. Click "Clone to Project" on any asset
7. Verify:
   - Success toast notification appears
   - Asset appears in the project asset list
   - Asset has `global_asset_id` set (check in database if needed)
   - If asset had an image, it should be copied to project storage

**Expected Result:** Asset is cloned successfully and appears in Stage 5 asset list.

*USER RESULT*: Passes 

### Test 2: Override Tracking on Edit

**Steps:**
1. Clone a global asset into a project (from Test 1)
2. Edit the asset's description in Stage 5
3. Save the changes
4. Check database: `SELECT overridden_fields FROM project_assets WHERE id = '74401e29-a537-4623-99b0-f2ea2eedfb9d'`
5. Verify `overridden_fields` contains `['description']`

**Expected Result:** `overridden_fields` array contains the edited field name.

*USER RESULT*: Passes  (see )



### Test 3: Version Sync Detection

**Steps:**
1. Clone a global asset into a project
2. Note the asset's `source_version` (should match global asset's `version`)
3. Update the global asset (change description, increment version)
4. Return to Stage 5
5. Look for "Sync Available" badge with count indicator
6. Click the badge to open sync dialog
7. Verify:
   - Dialog shows the outdated asset
   - Shows version numbers (e.g., "v1 → v3")
   - Shows asset name

**Expected Result:** Version sync UI detects outdated asset and displays it in the dialog.

*USER RESULT*:The Version number is present;  but I do not see the "Sync Available badge no where; perhaps this console log shows the issue more clearly: {{ projectAssetService.ts:445  GET http://localhost:8080/api/projects/18984948-7a45-4188-b1d8-5b96ddde58cf/assets/version-sync-status 404 (Not Found)
checkVersionSync @ projectAssetService.ts:445
await in checkVersionSync
checkVersionSync @ AssetVersionSync.tsx:52
(anonymous) @ AssetVersionSync.tsx:43
setInterval
(anonymous) @ AssetVersionSync.tsx:42 }}

### Test 4: Non-Destructive Sync

**Steps:**
1. Clone a global asset into a project
2. Edit the asset's description in the project (creates override)
3. Update the global asset's description (different from project version)
4. Update the global asset's `image_prompt` (or any other field)
5. Click "Sync Available" badge
6. Click "Update" on the outdated asset
7. Verify:
   - Asset's `description` remains unchanged (your edit preserved)
   - Asset's `image_prompt` is updated (not overridden)
   - `source_version` is updated to match global
   - `last_synced_at` is set to current timestamp
   - Success toast appears

**Expected Result:** Overridden fields are preserved, non-overridden fields are synced.

### Test 5: Sync All Assets

**Steps:**
1. Clone multiple global assets into a project
2. Update some of the global assets (increment versions)
3. Click "Sync Available" badge
4. Click "Update All" button
5. Verify:
   - All outdated assets are synced
   - Success toast shows count of updated assets
   - Dialog closes after completion

**Expected Result:** All outdated assets are synced in one operation.

### Test 6: Image Localization

**Steps:**
1. Create a global asset with an image
2. Clone it into a project
3. Check Supabase Storage:
   - Original image should be in global location
   - Cloned image should be in `project_{projectId}/branch_{branchId}/master-assets/`
4. Delete the global asset (or its image)
5. Verify project asset's image still works

**Expected Result:** Project asset has its own copy of the image, independent of global asset.

### Test 7: Promotion with Confirmation

**Steps:**
1. In Stage 5, ensure an asset has a generated image
2. Click the asset's dropdown menu (three dots)
3. Click "Promote to Global Library"
4. Verify:
   - Confirmation dialog appears
   - Dialog shows asset name
   - Click "Promote" to confirm
   - Success toast appears
   - Asset is now in global library

**Expected Result:** Promotion requires confirmation and creates global asset.

### Test 8: Clone with Override Description

**Steps:**
1. Open Asset Drawer
2. Select a global asset
3. Before cloning, note the global asset's description
4. Clone the asset (you'll need to modify the service call or add UI for this)
5. Provide a custom `overrideDescription`
6. Verify:
   - Cloned asset has custom description
   - `overridden_fields` contains `['description']`

**Expected Result:** Clone with override description tracks the override automatically.

### Test 9: Error Handling

**Test Cases:**
1. Try to clone non-existent global asset → Should show error
2. Try to sync locked asset → Should show error
3. Try to sync asset without `global_asset_id` → Should show error
4. Try to clone with invalid branch → Should show error

**Expected Result:** All error cases show appropriate error messages.

### Test 10: UI/UX Polish

**Verify:**
1. Asset drawer animations are smooth
2. Loading states appear during operations
3. Empty states show when no assets found
4. Search and filters work correctly
5. Grid/List view toggle works
6. Version sync badge updates automatically
7. All toast notifications are clear and helpful

**Expected Result:** UI is polished and provides good user feedback.






















We need to tweak!


### *Preface*: Assets can still be extracted & images can be genereated; AND like previously, visual style gets locked on selection

Future To-Dos:
## **Test 1**: Clone Global Asset into Project

Passes


Okay the global assets need to be able to accept and image input if they so like; for instance, image a user has a character they have already designed themselves and they want to use it in the story; they must be able to then use not just a written description but also the image as "the asset" though if they bring it into a project (in Stage 5) they should be made able to edit the image with a regeneration guiding prompt, so say they have a cowboy character, but for this story, he is in a soilder costume, as the plot involves said character in a war, they should be able to bring in teh cowboy from global to loca, then choose to edit it with the prompt to make him in solider costume.

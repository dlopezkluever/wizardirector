Three small, distinct houses stand scattered across a gentle slope.\n\nTo the left, a whimsical structure of straw, meticulously woven, stands precariously. This is PERCY'S HOUSE.\n\nIn the center, a more robust dwelling constructed from sturdy, interlocking wooden planks. This is PENELOPE'S HOUSE.\n\nTo the right, a squat, solid fortress of carefully stacked, weathered stones. This is PIP'S HOUSE.\n\nPERCY (30s, slender, bespectacled, wearing a crisp, slightly-too-small architect's smock) pores over a rolled-up BLUEPRINT, his brow furrowed in concentration. He meticulously places a single piece of straw, adjusting it with a tiny, precise movement.\n\nPENELOPE (20s, robust, energetic, clad in practical overalls and a tool belt adorned with various hammers and wrenches) energetically hammers a nail into the wooden wall of her house. Sweat beads on her forehead, but her movements are efficient and strong.\n\nPIP (teens, small, nimble, dressed in simple, earth-toned clothes) carefully balances a smooth, grey STONE atop an already impressive, spiraling tower. His tongue pokes out in concentration, his small frame radiating quiet determination.\n\nThe pigs work with focused intensity, each absorbed in their craft.",

His fur is matted, his ribs visible beneath his ragged coat. His eyes, like two dark marbles, fix on the pigs.\n\nA low GROWL rumbles in his throat. His gaze drifts from the straw house to the wood, then to the stone. His stomach GURGLES audibly, a hollow, desperate sound.\n\nHis eyes widen, a flicker of predatory hunger igniting. He licks his dry lips, a slow, deliberate movement.\n\nHe begins to creep forward, a shadow detaching itself from the deeper shadows of the woods. His movements are initially stealthy, paws padding silently on the grass. Then, a surge of resolve. He breaks into a determined, slightly awkward, loping run.",

SUNLIGHT glints off a tranquil pond where plump, happy DUCKLINGS, no bigger than fluffy dandelions, splash and play. Their MOTHER, ANYA, a strikingly beautiful duck with intelligent, alert eyes and pristine white feathers, watches them with a gentle, proud smile. She preens a stray feather on her wing, her movements graceful and serene. The air is filled with the sweet, innocent QUACKING of the ducklings.\n\nSuddenly, a guttural, industrial HORN BLAST tears through the pastoral calm. The idyllic scene shatters.\n\nFrom the horizon, a legion of GEESE, clad in stark, militaristic grey uniforms, march with unnerving synchronicity. Their beaks are sharp, their eyes cold, unblinking orbs of obsidian. Leading them is DUCK STALIN, a formidable, unnaturally large goose with a perpetually scowling, bulbous head, adorned with a single, menacing black feather that droops like a dark omen. He wears a miniature, ill-fitting military greatcoat, buttons straining. His webbed feet slap the earth with brutal efficiency.\n\nThe goose legion descends like a plague. They move with shocking speed and violence, their honks now aggressive, percussive commands. They snatch ducklings with their beaks, tossing them unceremoniously into crude, wire-mesh crates being hauled by hulking, goose guards. The ducklings’ happy quacks turn to terrified, high-pitched PEALS of distress.\n\nAnya’s eyes widen in horror. Her beak drops open, a silent scream caught in her throat. She scrambles forward, a desperate, futile attempt to shield her young.\n\n                    ANYA\n               (A choked, desperate sound)\n          No!\nBut the geese are too many, too fast. One of the larger guards, a brute with a scarred beak, shoves Anya roughly aside with a feathered wing, sending her tumbling into the soft grass. She watches, helpless, as the last of her precious ducklings is bundled away, their tiny forms disappearing into the oppressive grey of the goose army.",

Their vibrant yellow has dulled to a sickly pale. They huddle together, shivering, their small bodies gaunt. They are no longer playing; they are simply surviving, their eyes vacant, devoid of their former spark.

SUNLIGHT glints off a tranquil pond where plump, happy DUCKLINGS, no bigger than fluffy dandelions, splash and play. Their MOTHER, ANYA, a strikingly beautiful duck with intelligent, alert eyes and pristine white feathers, watches them with a gentle, proud smile. She preens a stray feather on her wing, her movements graceful and serene. The air is filled with the sweet, innocent QUACKING of the ducklings.\n\nSuddenly, a guttural, industrial HORN BLAST tears through the pastoral calm. The idyllic scene shatters.\n\nFrom the horizon, a legion of GEESE, clad in stark, militaristic grey uniforms, march with unnerving synchronicity. Their beaks are sharp, their eyes cold, unblinking orbs of obsidian. Leading them is DUCK STALIN, a formidable, unnaturally large goose with a perpetually scowling, bulbous head, adorned with a single, menacing black feather that droops like a dark omen. He wears a miniature, ill-fitting military greatcoat, buttons straining. His webbed feet slap the earth with brutal efficiency.\n\nThe goose legion descends like a plague. They move with shocking speed and violence, their honks now aggressive, percussive commands. They snatch ducklings with their beaks, tossing them unceremoniously into crude, wire-mesh crates being hauled by hulking, goose guards. The ducklings’ happy quacks turn to terrified, high-pitched PEALS of distress.\n\nAnya’s eyes widen in horror. Her beak drops open, a silent scream caught in her throat.

Her eyes, moments ago filled with maternal love, are now pools of raw grief, brimming with unshed tears. Her chest heaves with ragged breaths. She clutches a single, tiny, yellow feather – a relic of her lost child. The world has gone from Technicolor to a stark, brutal monochrome. Her entire being trembles with a nascent, potent rage.\n\nEXT. DUCK GULAG - DAY\n\nA brutalist landscape of grey concrete and rusting metal. Towering, barbed-wire fences encircle a sprawling complex of grim, utilitarian barracks. The air is thick with a palpable sense of oppression, a chilling silence broken only by the distant, mournful HONKS of guards.\n\nAnya, having traversed an unimaginable distance, crouches behind a mound of rubble, her white feathers now grimy and torn. Her eyes, once soft, are now narrowed, burning with a fierce, unyielding determination. She peers through a gap in the fence.\n\nInside, the ducklings are crammed into cramped, filthy pens. Their vibrant yellow has dulled to a sickly pale. They huddle together, shivering, their small bodies gaunt. They are no longer playing; they are simply surviving, their eyes vacant, devoid of their former spark. Guards, identical to the ones who raided her home, patrol with heavy, clanking boots, their faces impassive, cruel. The environment is deliberately devoid of any warmth, any color, any sign of life beyond mere existence.\n\n                    ANYA\n               (Whispering, a growl in her throat)\nMy babies…\n\nA cold, hard resolve settles over Anya. The grief has transmuted into a pure, unadulterated maternal fury.\n\nEXT. DUCK GULAG GATES - DAY\n\nThe imposing, rusted gates of the Duck Gulag stand shut, a symbol of impenetrable authority. Two GEESE GUARDS, armed with long, sharpened poles, stand sentinel. Their posture is bored, almost lethargic, a testament to their perceived security.\n\nAnya emerges from the shadows, no longer a cowering mother but a force of nature. She stands at the full height of her avian form, her wings spread wide, her head held high. Her eyes blaze like twin embers. She is a figure of pure, primal wrath.\n\n                    ANYA\n               (A guttural, earth-shattering

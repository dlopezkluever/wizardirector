So I tried generating a starting frame, and the ui seemed to show it was going, with a good responsive loading state, but it never seemed to get the image generated (OR maybe the image just isn't even being saved or generated)

I keep getting this network call & response, but no image appears (and I don't see it in any folder in my storage)

This mean the Ui just stays saying "generating image" for the area that is to show the starting scene generation. I tried refreshing, going to a different stage and returning; and still; nothing changed

Here is the reoccuring network call that doesn't change:

## Appendix: 4B.6 — "Extend Shot" Feature Consideration (Research Only)

**Ticket**: 7.4
**Priority**: LOW

> Worth considering compatibility with Veo 3 and Sora's "extend" capabilities for shots.

This is a **research task only** — no code changes expected. Investigate:
- [ ] Veo3 extend API capabilities (does the API support extending a generated video?)
- [ ] Design notes for "Extend Shot" UI if API supports it
- [ ] How this would integrate with cost tracking

Report back with a Markdown file about how to possibly integrate extend feature shot into our project

## Focused On the Content Access Carousel: 

For the Rearview mirror tab, I think we have more than enough space to implement a inner carasoul in the window, that, instead of just having the last still from the previous scene, instead is a carousel with all/many of the past stills generated from previous sceenes. Think, like  has enough space to worth having a couple of Stills (maybe starting and end frames) from past scene, (like maybe it really should just show them in a scrollable manner

I also think we could maybe even further enhace this with having the gneerated clips from the previous AND next scenes of the story

So imagine the user is on scene 3, and has already completed the full cycle for Scenes 1, 2, 4, & 5. This tab thne, when selected will have the videos, I imagine, as a carosel, this thier scene and shot number titled next/below, above the clip, and the user could cycle through. 

The other way is to have like a nested tab system under, with the scens that have clips available to be selected. The user presses the tab for the scene they want to review, and then you get this carasoul of clips. The on e in the center is playable, while the earler clips are on the left, the later ones on the right.


But if we do no nested tab systme. then opening it would start with the most recent previous clip as the highlighted, open, playable clip, and the scenes prior to the left, and the shots of the scene up next (ahead of you scene) to the righ

THus, you ipen this window: 

Open is Scene 2 shot E

To the left if you swipe, press the arrow, is Shot 2 D, and the one to the right is Scene 4 shot A (but basic carousel functionality here)

So if you go 2 to the right, (assuming the clips have already been generated) the opened clip is Scnee 4 shot B, the ont the right is 4c (one immeditaely to the left is shot 4a)

But there should still be the nest tabe.

We also have this basica functioonality for the STARTING Stills of each shot as well


Now, lets say you've only completed Sceen 1's clips, well then that would be the only thing availabe in the carousel. You press on to the right, and you're one Scene 1, shot A.

We need a name for this tab as well, help me think of how to name this

How can we improve the visual look of the Content Access Carousel? I was thinking Rearview mirror has enough space to worth      
  having a couple of Stills (maybe starting and end frames) from past scene, (like maybe it really should just show them in a      
  scrollable manner 

1. I think have a title thats most Left Aligned, that says Content Access , and  make it so all the the tabs) vanish when collapsed.  

Also lets

For the stage 5 extraction: we need the ability to "merge" assets as one, because think of times the asset extraction may make take different versions of a characters name (maybe a full name versus just the first name listed in different prats of the sscript,) and mistakenly list them as two seperate assets:

For exmaple: The asset extraction for a script lists, as characters: Dr. James Jones (Scene 1); James (scenes 2 & 3); Dr. Jones (scene 4).. but you know HEY WAIT, these are all the SAME character; well the user would probably want to to only have one master asset for this character.


Moreover there maybe an opposite situation, when the user has a character or asset, that chagnes significantly in the story, so much so it would be best too just have different assets for this character in different moments.

Consider the example: James has to dawn a grand disguise for a few scenes (4 & 5), but is other wise in his normal apperance. 
Well then, the user could then select James with scenes 1 2 3 4 5 & 7.  (& split) to have  James (scenes 1 2 3 & 7; James -disguise (4 &5).




 I want to focus this session on the following issues related to the Content    
  Access Carousel. See I have this idea that could be quite cool, and I think    
  add alot of value to the user, Here are the really unorganized thoughts I      
  have for it: (((  )))    Use

Maybe the move is to have stage 5 to create like the "platonic ideal" of the asset; NOT the starting version of it

Then stage 8 could be, rather than GENERATING asset again but just in it's starting frame, its about knowing how to VISUALLY describe the asset as it is to be transposed in the shot. 

For instance Persephone, it just has the girl with her facial features and general form described; voice; immutabel characteristics (pale skin, red hair, green eyes, etc.) OR if you have some drawing, or celebrity / actress you will have playing the girl


then in stage 8 it's about defining her in the shot  .. persephone in hades, She wears black dress, crown of bones, depressed, etc. STILL the idea is not to have a background for the CHARACTER. I think that is key, I think just having the actress as is would be good.

but stage 8 morphes from describing scene starting positions, its about having each shot describe each asset/correctly

Scene 1 Shot A: Wide shot no characters, just of the facilty of XXX location, but an arieal view, pushing in.

Scene 1 Shot B: inside the facility Persephone (YYY actress) sitting at a table, she wears XXX and is happy, eating
Demeter, (ZZZZ asset/actress) wearing blah blah blah.. sittin opposit

Scene 2, Shot C: close up on Persephone, WHo is happy as she SLURPS down soup, happy, 

Then for Frame prompt, it basially takes the shot info, the PLATONIC IDEAL image, and the descriptions refined in stage 8 

RATHER than what we have now, which has the asset, in a slightly more defined manner visually, but stil missing key nuance defined, and thus those "prompts"are too indeterministic. As the actual nuances of the shot are left to the LLM to kinda take a shot in the dark at 

It's just worth thinking about. 
...

PLAN: leave as is, lets seen if we can just get the stage 9 to get REALLY good at defining the shot in prompt form, basically to the degree my new idea thinks about, while, instead of just having some "RAW" platonic ideal image, the image is much closer to the truth of whats invisioned, as we have determined 

BUT THE BIG KEY will be, beign able to have the asset (whether from stage 5 or 8) be inserted in teh frame CORRECTLY, as RN im just not seeing it when it comes to stage 10, it really seems like its utterly disregarding my stage 5 & stage 8 visual asset AND its like the shot list just kinda sucks; its not descriptive enough, RIGHT NOW


Should we have stage 8 be broken dowm further; like instead of just scene instance images for the whole scene, the user has to go down each shot, and choose whether to keep the assets as is (like a button is there to press that says "use from last shot")

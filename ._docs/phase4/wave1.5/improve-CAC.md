probably make both bigger, and as for clips, gotta be a way to only show those which we're chosen as final instead of all gens. But maybe not

So for the clips, we really want like a carousel fuctionality, hwere the active video is in the CENTER, and you can swipe/slide/carousel through. Moreover, the active clip should take up a majority of the view, with the one prior and after smaller, on the perfierery. 


Okay our big issue remains the lack of using the actual generated assets in stage/5/8 in the flipping Frame generation. 

IT really needs to addressed before we can move forward.

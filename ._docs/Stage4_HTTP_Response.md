        "content": "EXT. ANCIENT FOREST - DAY\n\nSunlight struggles to pierce the dense canopy of an ANCIENT, TWISTED FOREST. Towering trees with gnarled branches claw at the pale sky. The air hangs heavy, thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves.\n\nHANSEL (8), a boy with a worn, patched tunic and a desperate glint in his eyes, leads the way. His small hand clutches that of GRETEL (6), whose ragged dress barely covers her thin frame. Her face, smudged with dirt, is a mask of weary apprehension.\n\nSOUND of distant, harsh VOICES (O.S.)\n\nHansel's head whips around, his brow furrowed. He can almost hear his PARENTS’ cruel words, sharp as shards of ice.\n\n<center>PARENTAL VOICE (O.S.)</center>\n> (Whispering, echoing)\n> ...too many mouths to feed...\n\nHansel quickens his pace, pulling Gretel along. Her small legs struggle to keep up, her breath coming in ragged gasps.\n\nEXT. ANCIENT FOREST - LATER\n\nThe trees press in even closer. The path, barely discernible, disappears into a tangle of thorny undergrowth. Hansel stops abruptly. He scans the ground, his eyes wide with dawning horror.\n\nThe trail of white breadcrumbs he meticulously laid is GONE. Not a single crumb remains.\n\nGretel bumps into his back. She looks up, her lower lip trembling.\n\n<center>GRETEL</center>\n> Hansel? Where did they go?\n\nHansel shakes his head, a cold knot tightening in his stomach. He forces a weak smile, but his eyes betray his terror.\n\n<center>HANSEL</center>\n> It’s… it’s fine. We’ll just… find our way.\n\nHis voice cracks. Gretel’s eyes well up, her small body starting to tremble uncontrollably.\n\nEXT. ANCIENT FOREST - DUSK\n\nThe last vestiges of daylight bleed from the sky. Shadows lengthen, morphing the familiar trees into monstrous silhouettes. The temperature PLUMMETS.\n\nHansel and Gretel huddle together at the base of a colossal, moss-covered oak. Their teeth chatter. Gretel sobs silently, burying her face in Hansel's threadbare tunic. Hansel wraps his arms around her, his own body shaking, trying to project a bravery he doesn't feel. The forest groans around them, an unsettling symphony of unseen creatures.\n\nEXT. ANCIENT FOREST - NIGHT\n\nAbsolute darkness. The moon is a sliver, offering no illumination. The air is BITTERLY cold.\n\nSuddenly, a faint, sickly-sweet AROMA drifts through the trees. It’s cloying, almost overwhelming, yet strangely inviting. It cuts through the damp, earthy stench of the forest.\n\nHansel sniffs the air. His eyes, wide in the oppressive blackness, follow the scent.\n\n<center>HANSEL</center>\n> Smell that?\n\nGretel, her voice barely a whisper, nods.\n\n<center>GRETEL</center>\n> What is it?\n\nThe aroma grows stronger, pulling them forward. They stumble through the undergrowth, drawn by an invisible force.\n\nSuddenly, a soft GLOW pierces the darkness. They break through a curtain of low-hanging branches and gasp.\n\nBefore them stands a small, dilapidated COTTAGE. But it’s unlike any cottage they’ve ever seen. The walls are constructed from GINGERBREAD, frosted with icing. The roof is thatched with CANDY CANES. Lollipops sprout from the ground like bizarre flowers. It’s a grotesque, yet undeniably tempting, confection.\n\nEXT. GINGERBREAD COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS\n\nHansel and Gretel stare, mesmerized. Their hunger gnaws at them, a physical ache. Hansel reaches out a trembling hand, his fingers brushing against the sugary wall. It’s real.\n\nGretel, her eyes fixed on a windowpane made of clear, hardened SUGAR, can’t resist. She breaks off a small piece of the gingerbread wall. It crumbles in her hand, flakes of sugary sweetness dusting her fingers. She tentatively licks it. Her eyes widen in delight.\n\nHansel, emboldened, breaks off a larger chunk. He devours it greedily, his hunger momentarily forgotten in the rush of pure sugar. Gretel follows suit, her earlier fear replaced by ravenous need. They gnaw on the walls, their faces smeared with icing and crumbs.\n\nSuddenly, the door CREAKS open.\n\nA figure emerges. It's an OLD WOMAN, impossibly ancient, her face a roadmap of deep wrinkles. She wears a dark, shapeless cloak. But her eyes… her eyes gleam with a predatory intensity. A wide, unsettling SMILE stretches across her thin lips, revealing surprisingly sharp teeth.\n\n<center>WITCH</center>\n> Well, hello there, little ones. Lost, are we? Come inside. Warm yourselves.\n\nHer voice is syrupy sweet, but with an underlying rasp that sends a shiver down Hansel's spine. Gretel, still clutching a piece of gingerbread, looks between the witch and her brother.\n\nINT. GINGERBREAD COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS\n\nThe interior is as bizarre as the exterior. The furniture is carved from rock candy. The fireplace is a hollowed-out cake. The air is thick with the cloying sweetness, now tinged with something else… something metallic and unsettling.\n\nThe witch ushers them in, her smile never wavering. She gestures to a large, sturdy WOODEN CAGE near the hearth.\n\n<center>WITCH</center>\n> You must be hungry. Have a seat.\n\nBefore Hansel can react, the witch GRABS him. He struggles, but her grip is iron. She shoves him into the cage, the heavy wooden door CLANGING shut with a sickening thud. A large IRON LOCK clicks into place.\n\nHansel cries out, banging on the bars.\n\n<center>HANSEL</center>\n> No! Let me out!\n\nGretel rushes towards him, but the witch intercepts her, her hand clamping down on Gretel’s shoulder.\n\n<center>WITCH</center>\n> You. You'll be useful. Help me.\n\nThe witch pushes Gretel towards a pile of dirty dishes by a grimy sink. Gretel’s face crumples, but she obeys, her small hands trembling as she starts to wash.\n\nINT. GINGERBREAD COTTAGE - LATER\n\nQUICK CUTS.\n\nHansel, gaunt and terrified, is shoved a bowl of thick, greasy gruel through the cage bars by the witch. He recoils, but his hunger forces him to eat.\n\nGretel, her eyes darting nervously, scrubs a pot with frantic energy. She tries to stay invisible, shrinking away from the witch’s gaze.\n\nThe witch, her face contorted in a cruel grin, forces more food into Hansel’s mouth.\n\nGretel drops a plate, it SHATTERS. The witch glares, her eyes flashing with menace.\n\nINT. GINGERBREAD COTTAGE - LATER\n\nThe witch stands by a massive, stone OVEN. Its maw gapes open, radiating intense heat. She holds a colossal, gleaming CLEAVER. The blade reflects the flickering firelight, sharp enough to slice through bone.\n\nShe runs a thick thumb along the edge, her smile widening. She glances at Hansel in his cage, then at Gretel, who is frozen by the sink, her face pale with terror.\n\n<center>WITCH</center>\n> Time to prepare for the feast.\n\nShe turns her attention to Gretel.\n\n<center>WITCH</center>\n> Little one, the oven. It needs to be just right. Go. Test the heat.\n\nGretel stares at the inferno, then at the witch, her mind racing. She takes a hesitant step towards the oven, her body trembling.\n\n<center>GRETEL</center>\n> I… I don't know how. It's so hot.\n\nThe witch lets out an impatient huff.\n\n<center>WITCH</center>\n> Foolish child! Like this!\n\nThe witch, with a flourish, leans her head and shoulder into the oven’s opening, demonstrating.\n\n<center>WITCH</center>\n> See? You put your head in…\n\nIn that instant, Gretel acts. With a surge of adrenaline, she shoves the witch with all her might. The witch, off-balance, tumbles forward into the roaring heat of the oven.\n\nSFX: A guttural SCREAM, cut short.\n\nThe heavy oven door SLAMS shut. Gretel gasps, her hands flying to her mouth, tears streaming down her face. She looks at the oven, then at the cage.\n\nINT. GINGERBREAD COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS\n\nGretel rushes to Hansel’s cage. Her hands fumble with the heavy iron lock. It’s stiff, resisting her small fingers. She throws her entire weight against it, a desperate sob escaping her lips.\n\nFinally, with a loud CLICK, the lock SPRINGS open. Gretel yanks the door wide. Hansel scrambles out, embracing his sister tightly.\n\n<center>HANSEL</center>\n> Gretel! You did it!\n\nThey pull apart, their eyes scanning the cottage. Hansel spots a large, ornate CHEST overflowing with glittering JEWELS and gold coins.\n\n<center>HANSEL</center>\n> Look!\n\nThey frantically stuff their pockets and the few remaining rags they have with the treasure.\n\nEXT. ANCIENT FOREST - NIGHT\n\nHansel and Gretel burst out of the cottage, the jewels clinking softly in their pockets. They plunge back into the suffocating darkness of the forest, running blindly. The trees seem to lean in, their branches like grasping claws.\n\nHansel, remembering his earlier mistake, pulls out a handful of smooth, grey STONES from his pocket. He begins to toss them ahead of them, marking their path. He glances back, ensuring they aren't being followed.\n\nEXT. ANCIENT FOREST - DAWN\n\nThe first rays of dawn paint the sky in hues of orange and pink. Hansel and Gretel stumble out from the treeline, ragged, exhausted, but alive. Their clothes are torn, their faces streaked with dirt and tears, but their pockets bulge with the weight of untold riches. The jewels spill out, catching the nascent sunlight.\n\nEXT. FOREST EDGE - DAY\n\nA small, sputtering FIRE burns in a shallow pit. Hansel and Gretel sit on the ground, huddled close. The jewels are spread out between them, a stark contrast to their emaciated forms and threadbare clothing.\n\nHansel pokes the fire with a stick. Gretel stares into the flames, her expression unreadable. Their eyes meet. A silent understanding passes between them – a shared trauma, a shared survival.\n\nHansel looks towards the dark, imposing woods they just escaped. He remembers the echoing words of his parents, the gnawing hunger, the terror of the witch.\n\n<center>GRETEL</center>\n> They won’t find us here.\n\nHansel nods, his gaze steady.\n\n<center>HANSEL</center>\n> We don’t need them to.\n\nHe looks at Gretel, a flicker of newfound strength in his eyes.\n\n<center>HANSEL</center>\n> We have each other. And… this.\n\nHe gestures to the jewels, then back to their own determined faces.\n\n<center>HANSEL</center>\n> We’ll be alright.\n\nGretel offers a small, genuine smile. The firelight dances in their eyes, reflecting a resilience forged in the crucible of fear. They are no longer just children lost in the woods; they are survivors, their bond unbreakable.",

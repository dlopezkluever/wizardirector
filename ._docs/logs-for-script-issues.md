## *I will also point you towards: 'C:\Users\Daniel Lopez\Desktop\Aiuteur\wizardirector\backend\src\routes\sceneAssets.ts' as when I merged all the work done in 3WT-1 inot main, I had a big merge conflict with that file, so maybe somethign got put out of wack there.*

The clock on the mantelpiece CHIMES midnight. The third day is ending.\n\nSuddenly, the door CREAKS open. PIPKIN hovers in the doorway, his form bathed in an eerie, phosphorescent glow. He smiles, a chilling, triumphant grin.\n\n<center>PIPKIN</center>\n\n> Time is up, Queen Elara. The child.\n\nJust as Pipkin advances, Elara stands, her voice ringing with newfound strength, though her hands tremble.\n\n<center>ELARA</center>\n\n> No! I know your name! You are RUMPELSTILTSKIN!\n\nPipkin freezes, his jaw dropping. His eyes, moments before filled with smug certainty, now blaze with fury and disbelief.\n\n<center>RUMPELSTILTSKIN</center>\n\n> Impossible! How could you?!\n\nHe stamps his foot, a furious, petulant gesture. The floor trembles. The air crackles with raw magic.\n\n<center>RUMPELSTILTSKIN</center>\n\n> You meddling fool!\n\nWith a guttural ROAR, Rumpelstiltskin stomps his foot again, harder this time. The room erupts in a blinding VORTEX OF LIGHT. He is consumed by it, his form distorting, then vanishing with a final, echoing shriek of rage.\n\nThe light subsides, leaving the room silent and still. Elara stands, breathless, her hand protectively over her heart. She looks down at the crib, where her baby sleeps, undisturbed.\n\nElara gently picks up the infant, holding it close. Tears stream down her face, but these are tears of relief, of profound gratitude. She looks out the window at the dawning sky, a soft, pearly light replacing the darkness. The experience has left a scar, a bittersweet understanding of the true cost of shortcuts and ambition. But in her arms, she holds the greatest treasure of all.\n\nFADE OUT.",

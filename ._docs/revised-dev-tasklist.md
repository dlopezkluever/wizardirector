Let's do this, I have made a new doc called revised-dev-plan.md; please keep in mind the findins here, and also keep in mind I huge list of minor and major tickets/issues to clean up regarding the application. I want to proceed to with the focus first and firemost of clearing out all the mock data and getting a trully basic functionality of the application working, to then return to refineing out the more edge / secondary design issues UX of the application. This means we need to redesign the later half of tasks + we need to clean up our docs to be updated, 

So currently- we have completed tasks 0-5.3 (added "tasks" that were completed that were part of handling some immediate design tickets)

My remianig issue tickets are listed here:

I've added an Eval tasklist that I know will be neccessary: 
Thats focused on refining how agents communticate & how data is passed

So you will now be appending tasks starting with Phase 6 and go forth

Start with handling on getting to a basic functionality of stages 9-12

THEN we will work towards making sure the data being passed post Stage 4 (the master script) IS passed as optimally and cleanly as possible, so much that the rest of the production process truly feels almost like a breeze for the USER, very little decison making neccessary.

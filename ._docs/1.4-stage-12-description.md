### **Stage 12: Video Generation, Review & Iteration Loop; description**

**Tool:** Google Veo3 API (Video \+ Audio generation). **Process:** Submits the confirmed Start Frame, End Frame, and formatted prompt to Veo3.

**Review and Error Handling:**

* **Video Playback:** User views the full scene, cut together from the individual 8-second clips.  
* **Issue Resolution:** The user can select one of three iterative paths:  
  1. **SUCCESS:** "Complete Scene." Returns to the Script Hub.  
  2. **VISUAL ISSUE (Minor):** "Return to Stage 8 (Frames)." Requires regeneration of the anchor frames, meaning the video will be re-queued and credits charged again.  
  3. **NARRATIVE/AUDIO ISSUE (Major):** "Return to Stage 7 (Shot List)." Requires deep structural changes, potentially leading to a cascade of changes in Stages 8, 9, and 10\.

### **Purpose**

Stage 12 generates the final video and routes the user back to the appropriate upstream stage if issues are detected.

### **UI/UX Definition**

* Timeline-based video player with shot markers  
* Issue classification controls:  
  * Visual continuity  
  * Timing  
  * Dialogue/audio  
  * Narrative structure
* **Render Re-Entry Logic** (Stretch Goal):
  * When a background render (defined in 12.2) is complete, clicking the notification or the "Complete" status in the Script Hub (Stage 6) must drop the user directly into the Stage 12 Review Player for that specific scene.

### **Agentic Tooling**

* **Failure Attribution Agent:** Maps issues to the most likely upstream stage

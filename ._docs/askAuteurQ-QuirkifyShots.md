## 1. **Claude AskUserQuestion tool to fill out full pipeline**

Ask questions regarding each, especially characters; more questions when more not understood

Need the prompts to describe spacial positioning and facial expressions more than currently

*Keep accents persistent across shot/vid generations & allow user to voice act if possible*

## **Personal Motivation**

Alot of this motivations comes with my own personal distaste for the lazieness, unoriginality, and basicly slavery to rapid dopamine a flashy edits which makes up most "entertainment" on soical media today

Additionally no show makes me laugh anymore, but theres hundreds of people I know on twitter who are hilarious, and I would love to see them be able to make stuff as one and togehter

*got to add group collaborations, ability to brainstorm, make characters, etc. (scrtch pad it up* ... image like a community of 20 esoteric shitposters who were able to publish a weekly decentralized animation show together; with taste etc. )


## **Quirk Chugusify the Shots**

### We need to allow for the user to choose the cinematogrphy / direcotr style too. This could be done in the visual style esecletion, or a n added selection criteria ; where the use is choosing how the camera shots are made/the cinematogphogy. Like maybe they are all symetrical, and clean shots (we s anderson   or maybe its' vary unbalancing and high action/bizarre expeirment al shots... look the reason i say this is because, like , its annoying to only see medium shot, mcu , bakc cto medium... like visisk yawn)

## 1.

This product is aimed to targe the pre-production workflow for AI video in the immediate, with later goals for the full production cycle. The most synonyms application in th emarket today is studiobinder, but it lacks ai automation, and a pipeline to directly feed the created script and nnarrative doucments, like character descriptions and story beat shets and treaments, into optimized frame and video prompts to be generated using the existing models. 



This comprehensive outline details the product vision, technical workflow, and creative philosophy for the AI-narrative pipeline, integrating all specific details and nuance from the provided recordings.

### **I. Core Product Philosophy: The "Assistant" Model**

The application is envisioned not as an autonomous content generator, but as a high-level productivity tool for creative directors.

* **The "South Park" Analogy:** The program serves as a **"replacement for a ton of assistants"**. Much like Trey Parker acts as the creative lead while South Park Studios handles the labor, this tool performs the "character acting that Trey can't do" and assists with "refining the story" and "giving criticism".  
* **Empowerment vs. "Slop":**  
  * The tool is **not** for "social media marketers that just spam out a bunch of slop" for views or advertising.  
  * It is designed to **"empower artists to be able to tell a story that they would never have had the time to do"**.  
  * The goal is to provide a result that is **"95% to 98%" satisfying** to the artist, where they feel the AI "knew what \[they\] were going for" and captured their specific humor and vision.  
* **Preserving the "Soul":** The developer intends to save artists from the "big headache" of frame-by-frame drawing and repetitive animation. The artist provides the "bare bones" and the "soul of the art," while the AI handles the mechanical labor of "making every single animation, every single frame".

### **II. The "Ask User" Question & Refinement Stage**

This is a new proposed stage located within the initial narrative style pipeline.

* **Clarifying Ambiguity:** Instead of letting the AI "go off and give you something that you don't like," the tool will actively ask the user questions about plot points or character traits that are "unclear" or "unsure".  
* **Bottom-Up Refinement:** This tool helps the user **"get to the bottom, clear out any wrinkles, and help find the story a little better"**.  
* **Defining Specificity:** Users can define highly granular details during this interactive stage, such as:  
  * Character **accents and dialects**.  
  * Specific **senses of humor** and unique ways of speaking.  
  * Resolving specific "plots" or narrative directions that the AI identifies as poorly defined.

### **III. Advanced Input and "Expansion" Logic**

A critical feature is the ability of the system to take incomplete, disorganized, or "rough" source material and expand it into a professional-grade project.

* **Handling Uncompleted Work:** The system is designed to take a "rough script that's not very sharp" or "half a script" and generate the remainder.  
* **High-Accuracy Expansion:** The true competitive advantage is the ability to take a **"rough sort of base of input"** and expand it into a completed project that is "very, very, very accurate to the source material".  
* **Rhythm and Style Recognition:** The AI should "know the way \[the author\] speaks," their language, and their "rhythm" to ensure the generated dialogue feels authentic to the user's established style.

### **IV. The Voice Acting and Dialogue Pipeline**

The tool integrates a dedicated stage for audio to ensure "real artists" can maintain the "fun of voice acting".

* **Input Methods:** Users can choose to **read the lines directly** into the app or **upload a file** containing the dialogue.  
* **Audio-First Generation:** If a user provides a recording that is "really funny or really dramatic" but differs from the script, the system allows the recording to "replace what the dialogue actually is".  
* **The 16-Second Seamless Split:**  
  * If a user records a 16-second block of dialogue, the system will automatically **"make two videos using your voice dialogue, cutting it right in half"**.  
  * The first 8 seconds go to the first clip, and the next 8 seconds to the second.  
  * The transition is **"seamless"** but allows for a **"different shot" or "different camera angle"** (e.g., transitioning from a "two shot" to a "one shot" or a zoom) while the audio continues uninterrupted.  
* **Voice Cloning Integration:** For ease of access, the system will integrate tools like **Eleven Labs** for voice cloning, though the platform explicitly "encourages users to... have the fun of voice acting" themselves.

### **V. Visual Integration and Sketch Transposition**

The pipeline allows for the integration of physical or digital "rough" artwork into the final AI-generated video.

* **Integrating "Bare Bones" Art:** A user can submit **"rough doodles"** or sketches for key cinematic moments (e.g., a hero slaying a dragon).  
* **Style Transposition:** The system takes these doodles and **"transposes"** them using the defined animation style and character designs.  
* **Composition Preservation:** The artist’s original sketch is **"imposed into the still and then into the video,"** ensuring the final product matches the specific shot the artist envisioned.  
* **Selective Design:** An artist might only design a "couple of stills" or "three lines" of how they want a scene to look; the system then fills in the gaps for the rest of the story based on those anchor points.

### **VI. The "Second Brain" (Future Big Picture)**

The long-term vision involves moving beyond basic generation into a personalized creative repository.

* **Past Work Repository:** The goal is to create a repository of all an artist's **"past work,"** including how they write, draw, and shoot video.  
* **Personalized Recommendations:** The tool becomes a **"second brain,"** generating recommendations and content based specifically on the user's unique, historical style.  
* **Beyond RAG:** While the developer previously considered RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), they suggest that for this "second brain" vision, they may "need to wait for some technology to get better" to achieve the desired level of personalization.

## 2 & 3 

This document comprehensively organizes the latest design philosophies, technical requirements, and core use cases for the Narrative-to-AI-Film Pipeline, as detailed in the provided audio recordings.

---

### **I. Core Philosophy: The Experimentation and Simulation Engine**

The application is envisioned not just as a generation tool, but as a space for creative "engineering" where ideas are tested before they are "sent" to production.

* **Engineering vs. Theory:** In creative fields, you often have to pick a path and stick to it without seeing the alternatives. This tool allows for the "engineering" approach—trying a bunch of different things and running "simulations" until you find the optimal model.  
* **The Creator as "Taste Tester" and "Critic":** The platform allows users to step outside the role of pure creator and become a critic of their own work.  
  * It offers a chance to "observe and see what’s good and see what’s bad and develop your taste through your own work".  
  * This rapid iteration helps distinguish what is "really entertaining" from what is "too over the top," "corny," or "unbelievable".  
* **The "Mockup" Utility:** The tool is designed for "rapid iterations of real" content, moving beyond simple 8-second clips or shitposts.  
  * It serves as a "visualized mockup" of a plot or direction to determine if the user should "put any more thought into it whatsoever".  
* **AI vs. Human Artistry:** There is an explicit acknowledgement that AI films may currently lack the "power" or emotional resonance found in human-made classics like *Eyes Wide Shut* or *Paris, Texas*. However, as a tool for "mockups" and "experimentation," its value is immense.

### **II. Advanced Input Handling: The "Disorganized Thoughts" Workflow**

Recognizing that creative notes are often "very disorganized," the application must include features to bridge the gap between cluttered thoughts and structured treatments.

* **"Really Disorganized Thoughts" Mode:** A dedicated stage or page—potentially called "Organize my notes"—where users can dump raw, cluttered files and disorganized paragraphs.  
* **The "Ask User" Clarification Tool:**  
  * The AI acts as an assistant that "works with you step-by-step" to resolve "patches in the story" where the user got cut off or interrupted.  
  * It functions similarly to AI coding assistants, detecting "nonsense" caused by interruptions (e.g., someone talking to the user while they are recording) and refining the core meaning.  
  * The tool asks clarifying questions like, "Hey, what’s going on here? What are we doing?" until a "completed treatment" is formed from the raw notes.  
* **Voice-Enabled Conversational Assistant:** Users should be able to speak their ideas directly into the app, having a "literal conversation with an assistant" to establish context for the story.  
* **Narrative Branching:** The AI can suggest and manage "branches" for scenarios.  
  * **Example Use Case:** A user can create one branch where a character is "secretly a part of the cabal" and another where she is "completely innocent" but still suspected by the hero.

### **III. The "Lore Library": Persistence and Character Psychology**

For series or multiple scenarios, the app requires a centralized "Lore Library" to maintain consistency across different generations.

* **Global Knowledge Base:** A library for all thoughts regarding "character, setting, and background".  
* **Persistent Character Traits:** The library tracks "core personality things" so the AI knows how to handle a character in future stories.  
  * **Example (Character Psychology):** Tracking that a character like "Ron" is generally "timid" and "nervous," yet possesses a "potent spark of courage when he’s really pushed against the wall".  
* **Contextual Dialogue and Action:** By knowing the lore, the AI can generate "sub-dialogue" or specific "awkward moments" based on established relationships and character secrets (e.g., a character being secretly in love but unwilling to say it out loud).

### **IV. Strategic Use Cases and Industry Positioning**

The tool is positioned as a bridge between "total swap content" and "intensive tools" like Unity or Blender that take weeks to produce simple results.

* **Indie Filmmaking and Animation:**  
  * Filmmakers can "throw a concept out for a scene... or for a subplot" and visualize it in "unpurposed form" for a minimal cost (e.g., \~$50) rather than wasting thousands on a physical reshoot.  
  * It prevents "wasting anyone's time" on set by allowing the director to see the vision beforehand.  
* **"Selling" the Vision:**  
  * Creators can share these mockups with local actors or investors to say, "Look, this is my vision. I want to make it real".  
  * Even if the AI generation is "clanky" or "not perfect," it demonstrates that the creator is serious and has "worked it out," making it easier to entice people to join the project.  
* **Accessibility and Empowerment:** The developer emphasizes that this tool is intended to be "empowering" for those without massive resources.  
  * **Creator Context:** The developer notes they are "not some rich prick" but a "homeless guy" living on the streets who is "passionate about this because I think it's cool".

### **V. Feature Roadmap and "Stretch Goals"**

* **Half-Finished Script Revision:** A feature where the AI helps complete or revise scripts that are "half-finished," asking the user where they intended to go with specific scenes.  
* **Optimal Result Formatting:** Ensuring that the AI generates optimal prompts and frames based on the clarified disorganized notes rather than "vague paragraphs".

---

**Summary Analogy:** The proposed system functions as a creative "taste tester". Instead of committing to a full production based on theory alone, users can "f\*\*\*\*\*\* generate it," see the "real vision of it in video form," and decide if it resonates before spending significant time or money.

# 4&5 

This document comprehensively details the latest technical requirements, strategic goals, and philosophical foundations for the Narrative-to-AI-Film Pipeline, as expressed in the most recent audio recordings.

---

### **I. Advanced Audio and Voice Acting Features**

The developer has identified a critical requirement for the audio stage of the pipeline to ensure that performances maintain human emotional resonance even when using synthetic voices.

* **Emotional Inflection Retention (Voice Print Shifting):**  
  * The system must allow users to input their own voice acting and clone it or change the "voice print."  
  * **The "Kevin Hart" Requirement:** A key feature is that while the user might sound like a different person (e.g., a celebrity), the **original emotion must remain**.  
  * **Preserving Nuance:** The system must capture the exact "inflection point" and "where the laugh was." The user’s specific "emotion the way \[they\] said it" must be preserved in the final output.

### **II. Strategic Partnerships and Brand Outreach**

The developer intends to use the "working motto" and the functional pipeline to build a creative bridge with specific authors and community leaders.

* **The "Aaronian" Collaboration:**  
  * The developer plans to contact "Mark," described as an "apostle of the Aaronian cult," once a working model is ready.  
  * **Animation Services:** The goal is to offer to animate Mark's stories, focusing on "fresh ideas" or narrative concepts that were "thrown away" or not used in his books.  
  * **Creative Experimentation:** The developer wants to "mess around" with these discarded ideas to see if they can create an animated product the author likes.

### **III. Social, Cultural, and Philosophical Foundations**

The recordings provide a broader context for the "why" behind the project, linking the creation of beautiful media to a desire for national and community restoration.

* **Restoration of American Rural Communities:**  
  * There is a focus on "up\[ping\] the grill" (enhancing the spirit/quality) of small towns and cities, specifically in states like **Montana and Colorado**.  
  * **The 50-Year Goal:** The developer aims to help these people return to "be like they were 50 years ago," focusing on "making our country more beautiful, more physically stronger, \[and\] more educated".  
* **Critique of Modern Christianity:**  
  * The developer views modern Christianity as a **"retarding force"** that has a similar effect on the American youth as **"opiates"**.  
  * **Self-Indulgence vs. Reflection:** It is argued that the religion has become "self-indulgent," making people feel "good all the time" so they "don't have to worry about anything else".  
  * **Shift from Community to Globalism:** The developer notes that 50 years ago, the faith was "just about like your community" and treated everyone with "love and respect" without being "politicized" or "attached to globalism".  
  * **The "Masturbatory" Turn:** The critique suggests the faith has "stopped being something of reflection and became something of like masturbatory".  
* **Apolitical Goal:** Despite the critique, the developer states they are "not a part of that" (the religious fix) and prefers to "move forward" to help people rise and "become the best version of themselves".

### **IV. Narrative Concept: "The Hedonism of the Void" (Sci-Fi Pitch)**

A specific narrative concept was detailed, serving as a potential use case for the "parody" or "sci-fi" modes of the pipeline.

* **The Setup:** A group of astronauts travel to an alien planet where they find inhabitants who "look like them".  
* **The Invitation:** These inhabitants are welcoming, telling the astronauts to "Bring them more and more. Come down. Come here".  
* **The Twist (Lizard Entities):**  
  * The inhabitants are not human; they are "secretly trying to... take something that was on their ship or take their fuel".  
  * **Biological Theft:** They "take joy out of like eating their blood," behaving essentially like "lizard people".  
* **The Law of Consent and Hedonism:**  
  * A central plot point is that the entities **"needed the consent"** of the humans to harvest them.  
  * **Purity through Sin:** For the humans' blood to be "pure," the entities require the humans to "accept the full surrender of hedonism".  
  * **The Suicidal Ideology:** The story explores the "suicidal ideology of hedonism" and "not caring about your fellow people," leading to the astronauts becoming "consumed by Dionysus".

**Summary Note for Development:** This documentation highlights that the pipeline is not just a technical tool but a vehicle for a specific creative vision that combines high-fidelity emotional voice acting with subversive, philosophical storytelling intended to revitalize community culture.

# 6&7

This document organizes the thoughts and narrative concepts from the most recent audio recordings, detailing a strategy for subversive myth-making and the professional context driving the developer's current urgency.

---

### **I. Narrative Strategy: "Aimful" Myth-Making and Utopian Reimagining**

The developer proposes a core content strategy for the pipeline that involves subverting classic myths and pop-culture narratives to transform them from "aimless" stories into "aimful," "badass" utopias.

* **Philosophical Pivot:** The goal is to take stories that typically end in tragedy or decadence and pivot them toward a vision of "becoming and touching God".  
* **The "Star Wars" Reimagining (Example Use Case):**  
  * **Plot Twist:** Luke Skywalker joins his father (Darth Vader) to rule the empire.  
  * **The Result:** Instead of a dark regime, they create a **"retro romantic utopia"** by getting rid of "all like the dark weird s\*\*\*".  
  * **Motivation:** The father and son duo realize they must control the people because they are "f\*\*\*\*\*\* up and they're stupid," but they do so out of a sense of "love for our people" and "community" rather than hate.  
  * **Ambition:** The narrative shifts from a struggle for freedom to an ambitious quest to **"transcend beyond the boundaries of the universe"** and dominate the horizon.  
  * **Conflict:** The protagonists are positioned against "losers" who have "no vision except for theft and decadence" and "Jewish husters" who want to "steal and gamble".  
* **The "Apollo and Daphne" Reimagining (Example Use Case):**  
  * **Plot Twist:** After Apollo destroys the Python, the spell of the tree is broken.  
  * **The Result:** Daphne loves Apollo instead of being transformed into a tree. He uses the sun to keep the tree from growing, holding and kissing her until she is restored.  
  * **Subversive Element:** The story explicitly rejects modern "subplots" (e.g., "be like a lesbian and hate Aryans") in favor of the couple having **"beautiful children"**.  
  * **The "Cupid" Antagonist:** The god Cupid is mocked as a "little kite" and a "cute little Jew c\*\*\*" who tried to manipulate their love.

### **II. Audio Integration: Persona Casting and "Clout" Strategy**

The pipeline will leverage AI to integrate existing public personas into these reimagined stories to generate "gem after gem" of content.

* **Voice Scouring and Cloning:**  
  * The system will "scour the web" for funny, out-of-context voice clips of figures like **Richard Spencer** or **Nick Fuentes**.  
  * If clips aren't available, the system will **clone their voices** to cast them as characters in the stories.  
* **Cast and Content Concept:**  
  * **Example Use Case:** A show titled **"AIM starring Richard Spencer"** or the "AIM affilian show".  
  * The AI would find perfect clips of Spencer making fun of "only fans girls" or doing imitations (e.g., "pretends to be like an Indian") and put them into the mouths of mythological characters like Apollo.  
* **Mutual Benefit:** The strategy is to give these figures "cloud" (clout) and visibility as a way to "repay them," which in turn helps the creator "get rich yourself".

# Raw Transcript:

general ideas for Aiteur. One, he asked uh ask the author the idea that with plot questions with things that are unsure very similar to plot codes ask user question tool. This will be a a little bit of a stage maybe in between somewhere in the first pipeline, the narrative style pipeline where it ask you questions about the plot, about the character, refine things that are unclear um that you know that you meant to define. So if you know if you give like a character summary, a description all the characters and there's things that aren't clear instead of letting the AI kind of go off and and give you something that you don't like, you can be very specific. If you give examples, you can talk about their accent. You can talk about their their sense of humor, their the way they speak, their dialect, whatever. Or things with applause. This is unclear. This is a plot. whole ask you the question ask you the question helps you get to the bottom clear out any wrinkles and help find the story a little better. Uh second feature that is new is um with the adding I want to add a feature this is specifically thinking about real artists who want to use the tool to help them streamline um maybe there's some shorts some things some throwaway projects some things for fun everybody still wants to really enjoy the voice acting element so there could be like a stage somewhere in between the script being made and the actual generation of the video um where you know I don't know but basically it's a stage where it asks you to either read the lines um or upload a file with the dialogue for the lines being read um it would replace what the dialogue actually is. So if you know if you speak differently and we get a recording that's really funny or really dramatic that you like but it's not exactly word for word with the dialogue. You can just switch it have that be the dialogue and then in the generations it will you know if let's say you do a voice acting thing for 16 seconds then the you know in the video generation it will make two videos using your voice dialogue cutting it right half. So you say the first 8 seconds that gets put on the first clip the next 8 seconds that put gets put on the second clip seamlessly but maybe a different shot or maybe you continue it however you like. Um, when I say different shot, I mean different camera angle, different, you know, maybe zoom in the next one is a is a two shot and goes to a one shot or whatever. You got to define it a little bit better. Um, but likewise with this, you could also just use 11 Labs and have it the voice be generated. If you don't have it, you do a voice cloning, have that kind of integrated there so the user can just ease of access um, you know, be able to clone a voice and use it in their video, but we encourage users to um be able to speak. You know, have the fun of of voice acting. That's fun. That's not a pain in the ass. It's not when I'm trying to save people like the big headache I'm trying to say to them is a frame by frame drawing and making every single animation, every single frame, every single shot, every single character design over and over and over again. That's what I'm trying to say to them. I'm trying to let them give us the bare bones of their work, their art. This is like the goal. This is how I plan when using it. I want to be able to submit my idea for the story. Maybe a rough script that's not very sharp. It's not edited yet. And, you know, maybe a few character designs and a few, you know, shots that I like for a certain scene. You know, at the climax when the hero finally slays a dragon, I have this this shot that I' I've sketched out. I want to look just like this in the story. And this one, too. this one too. You know, I want those to be be able to get integrated whether it's just a rough doodle that can then get transposed using, you know, the style of the scene and the and the animation style and the character design and get imposed into the into the still and then into the video. That's what I'm trying to say. I'm trying to streamline the the work of art without getting at the core. I don't want to make the whole thing. I don't want the soul of the art to be generated because I mean, we've all seen generated stuff generated writing generated, comedy generated stories. They all are just so midwy, so sloppy, so sloppish. So I want to retain I want to allow the the artists to make the story. I want them to make the the dialogue of the all to like the bare bones where the rest of the story you kind of know what's going to happen. You kind of know how the rest of the characters are going to talk. If you've designed, you know, three lines or you know, you already know how it's going to look you've designed a couple stills. You don't need to make all of them. That's what I'm trying to save them time for. So, right now we have basically, you know, in our current project setup, it is very much the generation does almost all the work. Um, you really the only time you're actually inputting is just at the beginning and you can make maybe some refactors manually, but a lot of the work is being generated. The next thing I want to integrate on top is this mode that it is very key. It is very important. It allows you the user to put together all the notes you have. So again, like I was mentioning, you have character designs, you have descriptions, but not for all of them, just for a few. You know, you have a a rough treatment, but it's not, you know, it's not fully worked out yet. You want the the the program to ask you questions to help you shape out the story. You have um well, not affecting the core of your writing, the core of your plot, the core of your dialogue, the core of your humor. That is is it's being that's the core of the thing that's being expanded out. it's not being replaced, if that makes sense. So, let's say you have like a half a script. You don't really know too much about the dialogue. You have rough treatment. You have like character descriptions for like two of the characters. You have a general style you're going for and you've drawn or you've animated or you made a a graphic for like a character or two or a scene or two, a setting or two. Um, you I want that to be automatically transposed into the pip like that that needs to be like taking that that input. It needs to be able to expand it throughout the pipeline. So, you know, if I'm giving it maybe a treatment and maybe half a script, it needs to be able to go make the rest of the script. You know, you give it a couple stills for a scene, you know, the first page and for, you know, the sixth page. Well, it needs to be able to then go and make the rest of the steals the rest of the story based on what you gave it like knows if you like these sort of because you know you like this sort of dialogue you know this is your rhythm this is how you you get what I'm getting at here we are like that is going to be like the true like uh the true way this is going to be able to beat the competition is if it's able to take from a uncompleted rough idea rough sort of base of input it's able to expand that out into a completed project being very very very accurate to the the source material. It knows what the writer wants. It knows the way it speaks. It knows its uh language, its style. And you know, obviously it's not going to be perfect, but it can be like what the the artist or the user feels like, wow, this is like this is exactly what I envisioned. It like it knew what I was going for. It knew my humor. Um but you know, there's some tweaks I had to make here and there, sure, and I made them, but everything else was quick. Boom. And then I had all my shots lined out and I could just put it into the editor and boom, we're ready to go. Like it that's just saved me so many hours while not just generating mindless s\*\*\* for me. This is not, to be clear, this app is not for, you know, social media marketers that just spam out a bunch of slop so they they could get views for their product or to do advertising. You know, this is not for mindless nonsense. This is for This is to empower artists to be able to tell a story that they would never have had the time to do. Um, again, maybe it's not going to be 100% how they would have done it. They get like 95% satisfying. 98, but they feel like it's really really good. Obviously, there's some things here or there I wouldn't have done, but whatever. Basically, it's like a it's like a it's, you know, if there's like a head animator of a show, this tool becomes a replacement for a ton of assistants to do all the work that they wouldn't had the time to do. You know, the artist is like Trey Parker. This program is like all the workers at South Park Studios for making the the animations, you know, doing the the the character acting that Trey can't do, helping with the story, maybe asking questions, refining the story, giving criticism there. Boom, boom, boom. That's a tool. And if you can get get really personalized, if you can know exactly what the style of the the the artist is, just and it knows how what it likes, what the user likes, the way he likes to tell stories, the way he likes to visually make things, you know, if we could find a way to almost this is out being a big picture. If we could have like a repository of all the artists past work, we know the way he writes, we know the way he draws, you know, we know that the way he shoots video, maybe you can then go and it can become like a second brain for the user where it's like it's giving you recommendations, it's generating things based on your own style. I was thinking rag before, but rag maybe it's not that good. Maybe there's we need to wait for some technology to get better there. Regardless, that's the vision we want to set up. You know, get the base stuff going and then eventually later implement that sort of second brain for users. All right, so those are just kind of some rough ideas I want to throw out there.  
you know, a use case I would love to see is that of experimentation. Um, you know, with artists, painters, people making movies, writers, you know, they really, um, especially like, uh, I don't know, I guess it's not exactly 100% true, but just hear me out here. You know, engineering compared to theory Engineering is is trying a bunch of different things, throwing anything at the wall and until something works, you get it right and then you build it. You get a model, you get a sort of a plan. How can I make this optimal? You have all these different simulations and once you feel like you got something that'll work, you send it and that's what you got. You know, with the painting, you get going, get started, and yet eventually you have to pick a path. You can't have the seven generate different variations, uh, different plots, you know, turns and and whatever. You can't really make it and see it for itself and know which one, oh, I really like this one or whatever. You know, you don't really get that opportunity. You kind of have to stick with, you know, you're making a movie, you only really get, you know, one script, one script that you're going to go and shoot. And, yeah, maybe if you have a big budget and you have all the time in the world, maybe you'll go and you reshoot a certain scene, but only minor tweaks. You can't really go out there and just make a whole like really go down this this rabbit hole, this different subplot, stick to it and see what happens. You can't really go down that and then see it, you know, a real model of it, a real the real vision of it in in video form, in movie form. You can't do that. You only get really one movie and whatever happens that that's it. And as an artist, you might do that and you go, "f\*\*\*, I I really thought This could have been better. I should have maybe done that. Well, I want this to be like a perfect use case for AIteur is uh allowing, you know, real indie uh filmmakers uh animators who are like working on a story to like throw a concept out for a scene or throw a or for a whole sequence or for a subplot and just kind of like write it out in this one way. We'll see. I don't even know it's going to work. I'll just f\*\*\*\*\*\* generate it costing I don't know a couple 50 bucks or whatever, whatever it cost you to generate whole thing. And there's $50. Now you get to really see what you're going for. And if you don't like it, it goes stupid than your original idea. Just set it aside. Nobody else has to see it. No big cost. You don't waste anybody's time. You, you know, have hundreds of people out at this shoot wasting your time because we have to reshoot this. But I didn't like it. Boom. Just take your time. You got to visualize it. in an unpurposeed form, you know, right? It's never going to touch a real thing, but this is like my dream if if if people are using it for this and are experimenting and getting to kind of really, you know, have a real chance to become like a like a taste tester. Like you could actually put your taste in something instead of just being a pure creator, you're also the critic. You can also experiment and and and observe and and see what's good and see what's bad and develop your taste through your own work, you know. To me, that's all very powerful and it's something I I play arguments for and I hope you know real artists who hate AI who hate AI art especially like AI arts are going to touch human movies I agree but and fine you know I actually don't think you could ever make a movie as as like ground shaking and or as unnerving as Eyes Witch or as emotional as uh Paris, Texas strikes that something inside of you that you can kind of relate and empathize with. I I do agree that there is a less power in AI films for sure. In fact, the only thing I really see good use cases of where I'm like, yeah, this is pretty valuable is like, you know, s\*\*\* post and comedy. So, I I I understand where you're uh where your uh hesitancy or maybe distaste for it comes from. Just don't feel as that sort of tool. Then, you know, instead of view it as like a as like an experiment, as like a a way to kind of quickly mock up is what they're called. They called mockups. You got to mock up a certain a certain plot or a certain a certain direction or maybe a whole crazy, you know, you got you had this idea. Let's just see how it looks. Should I even put in any more thought into it whatsoever? That's what rapid iterations of real, you know, beyond an 8second clip or 16 second s\*\*\* post which are funny. They're funny and you can make it with that too. That's not you know if you're going to do that just I mean why are you even using this tool? Why are you mapping it out? Just go make s\*\*\* posts. You don't need this is not for you. This is for people that I mean like the ideal situation is you are uh you know you're able to get 20,000 from your friends dad and Rich to make an art film but you have to pass this on as like the the side actor or something. But boom, he has 20,000 makeup. your first movie, whether it's a 30-minute movie, a documentary, whatever. And now it's time to how are you going to use that money? I think, hey, it's probably not a bad idea to use 50 bucks for that to try to experiment with all your different ideas and see which one you think has the best potential to to resonate with people, you know, to something you'd be proud of, something that's, you know, oh, you know, you might get insights from something or the way somebody speaks and, you know, the voice acting that's done. You got to see Oh, this is really funny or this is really, oh, this really touches this gets to something or this, wow, this is really entertaining. And then the other way you got to think, oh, that is way too over the top or that is that is just unbelievable. It's corny, not funny. Yes. I mean, that's that's if I was like 16, 18, 20 and I had that, I think that would have been really helpful for me. And, you know, not only just for yourself, not just a self-indulgent thing. It's uh it's something that you can then share with, you know, 20 of the local actors in your town and say, "Look, this is my vision. This is what I want to make, but I want to make it real. Look at this." Yes. Yes. It's not perfect. Yes. Yes. It's kind of corny. Yes. Yes. Clankers. f\*\*\* clankers. Yes. Um, you know, they're not human. They'll never be humans. I understand that. If you had that, it'd be much easier to sell it to a group of people. It shows that you're serious. You have a vision. You've worked it out. And it shows that you know, this is something they want to be a part of that, you know, you can entice them to come work for you, you know, for a for a beer and pizza and, you know, 1% rights on the film or whatever, however that works. This is like it's a merger between uh total swap content frameless just generate for me and you know the really intensive tools that take so many weeks and weeks just to make something simple. You know, you're using Adobe Animate you know, all these different like Blender. I don't know. I don't even know what people use. Unity. I don't know. I don't know what they build. But why why not give it a chance? That's my question. Look at me. I'm I'm a homeless guy. I'm not here representing Adobe asking you to give me more dollars. You know, I'm trying to give you a tool that I think will be empowering. Well, also, I mean, I'm not going to lie. I I need to whip my big too. That's just for like housing. That's just like basic like ah I literally live on the streets. So I'm not coming at you like some f\*\*\*\*\*\* rich prick, you know, just trying to weasel any dollars out of you. I'm like this is what I've been working on because I am passionate about this because I think it's cool and I'm having fun with it. Um so yeah, sorry that don't mean to disre Yeah. Check your proof. Okay. Very fun. Okay.

So with the inputs of like rough ideas, there needs to be a way for AI to kind of detect where there's like the patches in the story where where the user kind of got cut off or you know because people are very disorganized with their notes. They'll start writing maybe a paragraph of their treatment and then immediately add in parenthesis, oh but what if wait if you know Tara was uh secretly a part of the cabal? Oh maybe we need to think about that come back to this later and then they just start writing their paragraph from there. You know, people can be very disorganized. Um so maybe there could be like a separate page called like organize my notes, organize my thoughts before you put them into the inputs or maybe it can be in the pipeline. There could be a mode called like really disorganized thoughts where the ad will work with you, you know, step by step, page by page, ask you a couple questions, say, "Hey, what's going on here? What are we doing? What you want to what you want to try? Maze says, "Make a branch. Make a branch." Let's do one where she's part of the cobball, one where she's completely innocent, but yet the hero regardless suspects her. And we can kind of, you know, sense you can really work out these different scenarios. Okay. And they'll just work with you until it gets something resembling a completed treatment based on just your raw discussed notes. Um, I do like that sort of you ask us a question because it's really effective with CL code. you know, with your coding when you're giving it, you know, flawed directions and they're like, you know, use the voice messaging system and in the middle of it, you know, you got interrupted by a friend, you say, "Oh, hey, what's going on?" Then you go back to like saying your message and there's a lot of ums. Um, you know, using the ask user tool, ask user question tool. U, it will help like Cloud know, oh, okay, that that was nonsense. He didn't mean any of that. This is what he meant. Cool. We could refine on these ideas. So, if you could kind of implement that sort of spoolage as like an in between like immediately after the input if you go into like really disorganized notes or just even not even really just disorganized ideas you just put in all this clutter all these different files you're talking about other things and you let cloud or Gemini whatever you let AI tool kind of work with you and say okay okay so what are we getting out here with this what do we want to do with that okay okay what do you have here and maybe add like a little voice input so the user can just talk in and and kind of have like a literally like a conversation with like an assistant and then he could use that context that goes, "Okay, this is what he wants. Boom. Here's a couple treatments. What do you want?" I think that'd be a really really important cool stage. Um, but you know, there's also that one where you give like a script and it's it's half finished and you can kind of go and say, "Okay, let's revise this here, here, here. What were you going with with this? Where were we going with that?" And then, "Okay, this is like a stretch goal or whatever." I think it's It's the idea of like a lore library. So, say you're writing like a series or you're writing multiple different uh you're in multiple different uh scenarios and situations. You're kind of playing with different ideas. You can have like a little library for all the thoughts you've had regarding your character, regarding the setting, background. This is really for like if you want to make like a continued series and you want to kind of maintain a library for your characters, the things they know what they don't know, you know, friends, enemies, um, all these core personality things that like will help the AI in the future generations know, okay, you know, Ron Ron is a little nervous, yet he has this sort of potent spark of uh, of courage when he's really pushed against the wall, but generally tends to be timid. Um, he's in love with Hermione or whatever, yet he doesn't want to say it out loud. You know, he's a nervous young man, sensitive young man. Nobody understands them, has a pet rat. Um, you know, you can add all these things in there and then it knows like as it makes more and more stories for you, you know, you can have like a little subplot, a little sub dialogue with the rat or there can be a little awkward moment for Hermione. There can be uh, you know, moment where he gets pushed against the wall and he saves the day because, you know, that little spark inside of him gets channeled. Whatever. Nothing I'm a Harry Potter fact. I just recently watched some movies. I am a no fiction f\*\*. I am a history f\*\*. I'm a his fat and not a Harry Potter f\*\* because I'm not a Lord of the Rings chud. I am a pure I'm a pure mythology and and comparative mythology uh comparative theology. Sorry. Uh chat. Okay. Yeah.  
A couple ideas here. Obviously with the audio voice acting, you should be able to input yours and maybe clone it or sort of change the tone of the the voice like the like the voice print. I don't know what that's called. Like where you sound like somebody else, but the emotion should remain. So, you know, you do a voice, you want to sound like Kevin Hart, but you want your emotion the way you said it. Where the inflection point, where was the laugh? You want all that to stay but in his voice. That's a key feature.  
Once I got like a working motto, I got to hit up Mark as an apostle of the Aaronian cult follower of our leader. Um, offer to like make some of his uh stories, especially ones he maybe didn't even use in the book, like fresh ideas or things that were going to throw away like, you know, can I kind of mess around, maybe animate it, see if I can make something you like. Um, another thing is just um This is kind of a pivot, but with America, you know, the only thing is what we really need outside of just like Freedom Association or like our communities, especially our rural communities and some cities that haven't been raped by diversification to remain white European. Basically, more important than that is actually just being able to up the grill of these small towns and these in these cities in Minnesota or whatever. What's not Minnesota that's gone? uh like uh cities in Montana uh you know Colorado like how can we get these people to be like they were 50 years ago I think a big thing here we just got to remove the retarding influences and yes what I have said in the fact that Christianity is a retarding force that basically the same effect in today's America today's youth that like opiates have um in terms of like the effect on the psyche and what they end up doing with their lives Um, you know, they're both very self-indulgent. They both make you just feel like you're good all the time and you don't have to worry about anything else. Um, regardless of all that, uh, you know, I want to basically just help these people rise and become the best version of themselves. I think that's more important than racial things, just making our country more beautiful, more physically stronger, more educated, and and you know, it wasn't like the old towns in the 1940s America were all that well read or whatever or cared about the nuance nuances of literature or whatever. I mean obviously they read more but like it wasn't like the these people were always like intellectual people they just couldn't put down and want to learn learn philosophy and and science you know it was never like that but I don't know what happened but in the last 50 years Christianity has turned from something that was genuinely beneficial in terms of like it wasn't attached to globalism. It was just about like your community, your town being treating everybody as equals and with love and respect in your town, in your community. Um, it wasn't so politicized. It wasn't again so I guess twisted and turned into an opioid and and and and stopped being something of reflection and became something of like masturbatory. So, I think there's a way to fix it, but again, I'm not a part of that. That's for them to figure out. You know, my better idea is that we just kind of move forward. But again, not going to bite that. And then the last idea here red light is that remember that story about like this the this astronauts who like go to an alien planet and they see people that like look like them and are like, "Wow, welcome strangers." And they have like a little small difference, but regardless they look pretty similar and they take in all these people and they tell all these people, "Bring them more and more. Come down. Come here. But then soon like things get a little weird. They start like intermixing with these people and you soon see they like need their they like take joy out of like eating their blood basically like a making them like lizard people or basically like where it's like you know it's like they look like humans but they're not. They like over time they see like what's going on and it turns out they're just there to steal eat their blood and like the older fuel that they so desperately needed. And it was like them that actually brought the beacon telling them to come here. Like you're gonna be welcome here. Yes, come. But it was all like a lie because they were just secretly trying to, you know, either take something that was on their ship or take their fuel. There's something they wanted from these people, but they wanted to take it. And then the big thing like in the laws, they needed the consent. They needed you to do it for your blood to be pure. You needed to accept the full surrender of hedonism. and and giving into the basically the suicidal ideology of hedenism. Suicidal ideology of not caring about your fellow people and just becoming consumed by dian ISIS in a way.  
So the idea is taking or one is changing myths to be aim to make them aimful instead of gem you know making Luke Skywalker join his father and ruler of the empire make it badass and make it this like total utopia this like retro romantic utopia. They kill the Sith. They got rid of all like the dark weird s\*\*\*. They they coless his father and son saying hey We understand that life, you know, we have these these ambitions and all these people, they're f\*\*\*\*\*\* up and they're stupid and we we control them. But we don't hate them. We love them. We love our people. We love our community. We can ascend. We can dominate over the horizon, maybe even transcend beyond the boundaries of the universe. Even, you know, they have this ambition. It's a look at these disgusting, you know, teddy bears and these second, you know, Jewish husters who are like stealing my sister. Uh they just they just want to like steal and gamble and be drunk because they're losers and they have no f\*\*\*\*\*\* ambition and they have no vision except for theft and and decadence. But no, we we have this vision of becoming and touching God, you know, whatever. The next one being like Paulo and Daphne, an obvious one. He destroys Python. And even though Cupid shoots Daphany. She loves him instead of her turning into a tree. He like uses the sun and like keeps the the tree from growing and holds her and kisses her and she and she the spell breaks with the kiss and they say, "No, this f\*\*\*\*\*\* little Jew tried to make me like love be BBC and and be like a lesbian and hate Aryens, but I realize now that you are." Wow, this is great. We can have beautiful children. cute little Jew c\*\*\* Cupid, you know. So those ideas, right, making them funny in this way while also this is very key and it doesn't necessarily need to be like this, but this could be very funny, especially if you find the right applications, but it's like grabbing like voice cuts of Richard Spencer as he's like, you know, making fun of like a girl only fans girl like, "Oh yeah, f\*\*\*\*\*\*." Or even when he's telling these stories and he's like putting himself in the shoes and he, you know, pretends to be like an Indian. Remember I man, you know, whatever. You take these clips of his voice recording and you put them into these AI stories. That perfect one would be like if he ever talked about being Apollo, he said, "Now, f\*\*\* you, little little kite Cupid." Maybe clone his voice and have him say that. And and it could be like AIM starring Richard Spencer. The AIM affilian show starring Richard Spencer. That could be f\*\*\*\*\*\* just gem after gem. He does the same thing with Nick when he does voice act. He does these invitations. You put them in there and you can use AI to find these perfect clips. You can scour the web, the internet. People already clip these guys out of context anyways. Find the funny stuff and you can put these characters into the stories and then help them. And that's how you repay them. You don't have to give them money, but you give them cloud and obviously you'll get rich yourself. Boom. Another way is even if you can't find clips, it's just to clone their voices and then cast them as a characters. f\*\*\*. Yeah, let's do it.

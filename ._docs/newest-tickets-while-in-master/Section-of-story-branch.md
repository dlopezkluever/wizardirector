Imagine the following situation:

A user progress through the Phase A Narrative and Style pipeline (stages 1-5), gets 9 scenes generated and goes about completing the production cycle to satsifaction with the first 3 scenes, but discovers that he no longer likes EITHER

The way a certain number of scenes in the middle 3-5 go about, narratively

OR

The way the story ends scenes 7-9

OR just scenes 4 & 9 in particular.

What would be the best way for the user to be able to pivot towards making the corrections WITHOUT losing all the content he's made regarding Scenes 1-3, and maybe some in between as well? 

We want to ABSOLUTLY make sure, he doesn't lose access to the generations he's made in stage 5 AND al the content generated, from frames, to assets to videos, for scenes 1-3.

## Brainstorm Solutions:
(
When adding branching logic) add a modal that appears when you unlock that says, what would you like to invaldiate, (or more, what would you like to keep valid & unchanged? and its based off scenes, so like the system reductively knows which parts of the script are tied to which scenes, so if the user chooses "Don't invalidate" scenes 1-3, they somehow staye coded in the system, (and are uneditabel when user is messing with the script; making his edits, regenerating parts, ettc. and when the user APPROVES of his revised script, the old scenes remain in the scenes storage, and the new ones go in and populate the rest of the scenes Storage for this new branch, and apon arrival to the script hub, the scenes that were keep remain as they were

The user can also add new assets /characters in the stroy, and extract them in stage 5, the ones that were extracted aren;t removed, like for the scenes that were kept, the assets of scenes that were edited do get 
"re-extracted" BUT if they already have descriptions / content/ generated images, it's not like all that should be deleted just to make the user do it all over again... maybe the re-extraction has to have the user choose which to keep and which to remove for the new scenes? ))

The reductive - beat shett & Treatment (maybe add a comment / pop up modal that states: "ractivly edit the treatment to include the information of the beat sheet IF the beat sheet is indeed edited; If beat sheet is not edited, then it can just proceed to the master script). So these two stages sort of lock together if that makes sense; their codependents. 

We need to make 
 Do 

Need to be able to edit the durration of a beat; when you add a new one it will automatically add it to 20 seconds, which is annoying if it was just a short moment you seeked to add; better to make like a little dial to increase/decrease the lenght, or to add the ability to just change the time. (they should be viewed as)

after the assets are defined (characters described & master/base images are made, then maybe proceed to make a hidden (backend only "master descriptive document") IF it seems it's needed; )

## {Need to worry about the time alotment being followed. for instance; you set a project for 2-3 minutes, but then find you get like 6 scenes and each scene has 6-10 8s shots; thats clearly undesired yet it is occuring, we need to be able to have more control here, maybe if the user seeks to extend it as he finds the story / project needs mor shots, then fin, but there should at least be a sort of counter on screen where you can track how much the project is balloning you know. 

I know the beat sheet has time allouments per beat, maybe easy jusst add them up and show on screen "projected run-time: {sum of beats' time} and then later in the script hub, it can have a projected run time; OR MAYBE stage 7 can start having a running tally with all the shots to be made and their duration. So for example, scene 1 has 5 s

*FUTURE IMPROOOVEMENT*
New Input mode: Video Explainers:
Where all you want is visuals for your video essay, explainer, etc.  

Maybe the way to fix this is: move "Project Type" to the top:

Then, if Narative; keep the 4, consider changing script-skip to Structured-Input OR "Streamline" (subtitle: "Enter Structured Docs and Fly Through the Pipeline)

Then you

#### Defered-A: Make the stage 2-4 UI componenets, for items like the regernation box button, to be consistent

*On top of this all I would like to fix the hard locking that is rather unnneccesary and annoying, present in stage 5 & 8, users make mistakes, they shouldn't be forcedibly stuck with decsision made if they quickly change thier minds; instead, make it a soft lock, like that of the frame prompts in stage 9. ## Note, the asset style guide isn't forever inmutably locked, like the user can come back and chose to unlcok and change it, it should just be noted, especially for branching reasons, that it should trigger a branch. ## For asset: Make sure allowing for just writing in plain english that style tone maybe good. YOU DONT HAVE TO CHOOSE A STYLE GUIDE.*

  Notes: Are the fucking assets being called in or not? I mean WHAT THE FUCK IS the poitn if not?? 

We need the ability to offer more, and the framing really need to speccify more 

Like the actuall frame need to have a tool where you have all the assets for the shot next to the prompt and you can just rolL! 

like its a shot of two guys at a mexican standolf, and you have the two characters already generated, one facing left, the other right, 10 feet between, each ahs a special gun, and the assets used are the backgroud, theguns, adn then Men want the continuity between shots, which is nicce about using the asset images to generate the subsequent frame, if we aren't doing that theres literally no point

(maybe the scene instance needs to be further stemed down to shot by shot, but idk maybe NOT, HOPEFULLY NOT)

need the ability to "merge" assets as one, so when the web app extracts 

## Stage 5:  #modal needs to be scrollable; allow props to be deleted.

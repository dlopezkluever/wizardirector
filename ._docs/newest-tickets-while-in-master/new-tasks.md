The reductive - beat shett & Treatment (maybe add a comment / pop up modal that states: "ractivly edit the treatment to include the information of the beat sheet IF the beat sheet is indeed edited; If beat sheet is not edited, then it can just proceed to the master script). So these two stages sort of lock together if that makes sense; their codependents. 

We need to make 
 Do 

Need to be able to edit the durration of a beat; when you add a new one it will automatically add it to 20 seconds, which is annoying if it was just a short moment you seeked to add; better to make like a little dial to increase/decrease the lenght, or to add the ability to just change the time. (they should be viewed as)

after the assets are defined (characters described & master/base images are made, then maybe proceed to make a hidden (backend only "master descriptive document") IF it seems it's needed; )

## {Need to worry about the time alotment being followed. for instance; you set a project for 2-3 minutes, but then find you get like 6 scenes and each scene has 6-10 8s shots; thats clearly undesired yet it is occuring, we need to be able to have more control here, maybe if the user seeks to extend it as he finds the story / project needs mor shots, then fin, but there should at least be a sort of counter on screen where you can track how much the project is balloning you know. 

I know the beat sheet has time allouments per beat, maybe easy jusst add them up and show on screen "projected run-time: {sum of beats' time} and then later in the script hub, it can have a projected run time; OR MAYBE stage 7 can start having a running tally with all the shots to be made and their duration. So for example, scene 1 has 5 s

New Input mode: Video Explainers:
Where all you want is visuals for your video essay, explainer, etc.  

Maybe the way to fix this is: move "Project Type" to the top:

Then, if Narative; keep the 4, consider changing script-skip to Structured-Input OR "Streamline" (subtitle: "Enter Structured Docs and Fly Through the Pipeline)

#### Defered-A: Make the stage 2-4 UI componenets, for items like the regernation box button, to be consistent

*On top of this all I would like to fix the hard locking that is rather unnneccesary and annoying, present in stage 5 & 8, users make mistakes, they shouldn't be forcedibly stuck with decsision made if they quickly change thier minds; instead, make it a soft lock, like that of the frame prompts in stage 9. ## Note, the asset style guide isn't forever inmutably locked, like the user can come back and chose to unlcok and change it, it should just be noted, especially for branching reasons, that it should trigger a branch. ## For asset: Make sure allowing for just writing in plain english that style tone maybe good. YOU DONT HAVE TO CHOOSE A STYLE GUIDE.*

  Notes: Are the fucking assets being called in or not? I mean WHAT THE FUCK IS the poitn if not?? 

We need the ability to offer more, and the framing really need to speccify more 

Like the actuall frame need to have a tool where you have all the assets for the shot next to the prompt and you can just rolL! 

like its a shot of two guys at a mexican standolf, and you have the two characters already generated, one facing left, the other right, 10 feet between, each ahs a special gun, and the assets used are the backgroud, theguns, adn then Men want the continuity between shots, which is nicce about using the asset images to generate the subsequent frame, if we aren't doing that theres literally no point

(maybe the scene instance needs to be further stemed down to shot by shot, but idk maybe NOT, HOPEFULLY NOT)

There needs to be a way to "match time point" between the start of one shot and then end of the other

  By this I mean, you cn use the end shot of one frame for a yet to be generated start of the next shot, the shot could be designated as matching completely (literally just copy it over) OR you can still "cut to different angle" but the generatio

  **Note** Video generation prompts must amply describe facial expression, bloacking (see matrix idea), or atleast framing

  *NEW* allow ai to suggest expirmental shooting techniques for certain moments ( i maean it can have as much frequency as the user wishes) but like maybe it has in memmory like you know, some nerd's compiled list of all the "most legendary shots in film / anime history"  and just let the LLM cook wtih recommendations, replacing the somewaht basic "Close Up", "Medi

Oh we totally need an Anime mode for the anime lovers

I want to replace all the generic icons in my application with my own custom version, that I will make with AI, because the generic ones make our application look stupid

would it be possible to train to make my own model that tailors "style" for users in

more stylized shots, for shot list, and then allow for planed shots (like match cuts)

# *Also in claudestorming.md* **Film "Samplimg"** *Remixing Existing Works (lawyers may ruin this)* **Who framed roger rabbit-ification ability**

I recognize that one-shot / few shotting has more potential than RAG, so with that I want to consider the ability to "film sample", sorta lke hip hop/kanye & electronic music where they grab small clips from an existing piece of music; they usually alter it in some way, so as to make a key aspect of a new song they basically expanded on. 

Many film directors do a similar thing in FILM, Tarantino (not too be to basic here) comes to mind, Kill bill in articular borderline plagerises the action sequences from old JAP / kungo foo film, 

Im not neccesarily talking about storylines here, though thats not outside the realm either, but rather im focused like primarily on editing/blocking/choreopgraphy, action or dramtic sequences, things that are VISUALLY stylized in a memorable way from past motion picture works, that a user may want HIS project to basicallyeither replicate, or exapnd on.

This will take alot of testing to see just how, well, robust the models can interpert the meaning of a users request, and understand a clip and how to replicate it on your film

Induldge me in an example of the possible workflow:

User's film has a high tension car chase scene between characters,

The user submits a clip (likely will have to provide the actual .mp4 though it would be just soo convientnet if they could just wrtie about it in) from a movie they saw that had a really dramatic car chase they want to emualte in their film (im thinking "one battle after another" car chase scene between the christmas adventurer, wilma, and Bob ferguseon)

We could maybe provide a library of clips outself, OR even better, tailor our backend to be able to take ALLL submited clips by past users and enter into our global "sample " library

and the goal is to basically use the sequence of the submited clip as a key reference for hwo the video gen / OR scene shotlist, and/or frame prompts/gens to replicate it, BUT in the context of the users sotry. 

So for example, in theusers story, its based in rocky mountains, and its in pixar style animation with fixtional alien characters, The output should look and have the context of THIER story and visuals, but with the submited clips style of editing, shots, and pacing or whatever.

## *Antoher idea*

"Your remix", you can take scene/ scenes of a movie/show etc. and add your like basically fan fiction and make it look just like it did in the movie, with the characters looking adn talking the smae, but with your plot , twist , remix

For example:

User chooses to REMIX Star Wars Epidoe 6 Return of the Jedi, 

It starts in the heat of the confrontation between luke and vader and sith, but in the users, his remix is that LUKE joins his father, they kill the sith together, and they, now acting as one, squah the rebeliion, and rule the galaxy as father and son, WHOLE SOME family ending <3. 

it can be as expansive and long as the user desires. Maybe it s just a 60 second gaff REMIX for social media OR its like a really well thought out, true fan fiction that has come to life now with ai tools

My question is, would this end up getting us Sued the living shit out of?

## *Idea 3*: 

Power to the "everyday"/regular person who want to be actors & directors but have no money to make a real film.

They film shots in front of a green screen or even just like in thier bead room, and Our AI fills in the rest. They can be put into existing worlds (them in star wars OR it can be something totally novel.

Like image them in tatuine, idk with a plot of them bieng a bounty hunter, all the filmed aspects were done outside or in thier room or whatever, the ai extracts just the relevant aspects of the footage, the  actor, and maybe some small props, and then enhances thier costumes / the props, and makes the enviorment that of thier location asset and its like they were in a multi million dollar suit, with all these extra characters being put into the scnee as well,

In thier filmed footage, its just the average joe actor talking and saying his lines and "fighting" completely alone, to nobody, but with it transposed in the ai generation, there are real side characters that are put in the space the character is interacting with, who are talking with them OR even fighting them. Could be truly incredible, but very "Next level.

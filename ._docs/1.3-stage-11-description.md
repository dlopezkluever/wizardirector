Stage 11: Confirmation & Gatekeeping (The Credit Check)**

**Function:** This stage serves as the final **economic gatekeeper** before the expensive Veo3 generation.

* **Display:** A "Checkout" review screen summarizing the scene:  
  * List of all shots (3A, 3B, 3C...).  
  * Image pair (Start Frame / End Frame) for each shot.  
  * Final synthesized prompt for each shot.  
  * Calculated **Total Credit Cost** for the scene's video generation.  
* **Action:** User clicks "Confirm & Render." This queues the job for Stage 10\. No further manual edits are possible past this point.

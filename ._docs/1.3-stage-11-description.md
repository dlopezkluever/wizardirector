Stage 11: Confirmation & Gatekeeping**

### **Purpose**

Stage 11 provides a final economic and dependency review before video generation.

### **UI/UX Definition**

* Scene summary with all shots  
* Start/end frame previews  
* Prompt snapshots  
* Cost breakdown  
* Dependency warning if applicable

No agentic tooling is used in this stage.

Stage 11: Confirmation & Gatekeeping (The Credit Check)**

**Function:** This stage serves as the final **economic gatekeeper** before the expensive Veo3 generation.

* **Display:** A "Checkout" review screen summarizing the scene:  
  * List of all shots (3A, 3B, 3C...).  
  * Image pair (Start Frame / End Frame) for each shot.  
  * Final synthesized prompt for each shot.  
  * Calculated **Total Credit Cost** for the scene's video generation.  
* **Action:** User clicks "Confirm & Render." This queues the job for Stage 12\. No further manual edits are possible past this point.

More Notes:
Regarding the "dependency warning":

  Phase 4 (later): Feature 4.1 (End-State Summary Generation), 4.3 (Enhanced Continuity Risk Analysis), and 3.3 (Advanced Asset Inheritance) introduce end-state summaries, content-aware continuity, asset state tracking, character/setting consistency. That’s when “full” dependency analysis is built.

  So: Stage 11’s dependency warnings in Phase 1 should be achievable with data that already exists after Stage 10 (frames + shots), without waiting for Phase 4’s end-state and continuity systems.

   Full dependency analysis
  Do not do now.
    “Asset state tracking, character consistency, setting continuity” depend on Phase 4 (4.1, 4.3) and possibly 3.3.
     Say clearly: “Full dependency analysis is Phase 4; we’re not implementing it in Stage 11 for this task.”
    
    “Asset state mismatches” from the spec can be interpreted narrowly for Phase 1: e.g. “required frames or shots are missing / not approved” (covered by 1 + 2). Broader “asset state” (inheritance, character state, etc.) belongs in Phase 4.

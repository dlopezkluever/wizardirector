            "scriptExcerpt": "EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY\n\nThe harsh glare of the midday sun beats down on a half-finished suburban house. Dust motes dance in the air, thick with the smell of sawdust and sweat.\n\nBOB (40s), his face weathered and kind, but etched with the fatigue of routine, swings a heavy sledgehammer. His muscles bulge under a sweat-stained, sleeveless work shirt. His work jeans are caked with dried mud. Each THUD of the hammer against concrete is a percussive beat in the symphony of his predictable life. He pauses, wipes sweat from his brow with the back of a calloused hand, his gaze momentarily drifting to the endless expanse of blue sky, a fleeting hint of something more.\n\nSOUND of a screeching car\n\nSuddenly, a beat-up, mud-splattered sedan fishtails violently into the site, kicking up a spray of gravel. The driver's side door is flung open before the car has fully stopped.\n\nDR. ARIS THORNE (50s), a whirlwind of frantic energy, tumbles out. He's a disheveled genius, his tweed jacket rumpled, his tie askew, wild grey hair escaping from a hastily tied ponytail. He clutches a worn leather briefcase like a lifeline. His eyes, wide and manic, dart around, finally locking onto Bob.\n\n                    THORNE\n               (Gasping, breathless)\n          You! You're Bob! The builder! Oh, thank the stars!\nBob lowers his hammer, a look of utter bewilderment replacing his stoic expression. He blinks, unsure if he's hallucinating.\n\n                    BOB\n               (Confused)\nUh, yeah. That's me. Who the hell are you?\n\nThorne scrambles towards Bob, heedless of the mud. He fumbles with the latches on his briefcase.\n\n                    THORNE\nNo time! No time at all! It's about your heritage, Bob. Your *true* heritage. You're not just a builder. You're… a Nephilim.\n\nBob stares, his mouth slightly agape. He glances at his hammer, then back at Thorne, as if expecting a punchline.\n\n                    BOB\nA… what now? Look, pal, I think you've got the wrong guy. I build houses, I don't… commune with angels.\n\n                    THORNE\n               (Ignoring him, pulling out a tablet)\nThey're waiting for you. The Lunar Collective. They sent a message. It’s a directive. A plea. For *you*.\n\nThorne shoves the tablet into Bob's chest. On the screen, a complex series of glowing symbols pulse against a backdrop of the moon.\n\n                    THORNE\nThey expect you, Bob. Their lost son. And Earth… Earth has a seventy-two-hour deadline. Deliver you, or face annihilation.\n\nBob stumbles back, the tablet slipping from his grasp and clattering onto the dusty ground. He shakes his head, a nervous laugh escaping him.\n\n                    BOB\nAnnihilation? Lunar Collective? What are you talking about? This is insane.\n\nThorne, undeterred, kneels and retrieves the tablet. He quickly swipes through screens, his fingers flying across the interface.\n\n                    THORNE\nInsane? No, Bob, terrifyingly logical. Look!\n\nHe holds up the tablet again, now displaying a series of high-resolution satellite images. One shows an anomalous energy signature emanating from the moon. Another displays a spectral analysis, charts and graphs Bob can’t possibly comprehend, but the complexity is undeniable.\n\n                    THORNE\nThis is spectral data from the lunar surface. Unexplained energy fluctuations, a pattern matching ancient celestial texts. And this… this is a projected trajectory. For *you*.\n\nBob squints at the screen, his brow furrowed. The images, though alien, possess a strange, undeniable weight. He looks from the tablet to Thorne's earnest, almost desperate eyes. The rhythmic clang of his hammer feels a million miles away.\n\nCLOSE ON BOB'S FACE\n\nThe bewilderment is slowly being replaced by a dawning, horrifying comprehension. The sheer impossibility of Thorne's words wars with the conviction in the man's voice and the strange, compelling evidence on the screen. The weight of the world, a burden he never asked for, begins to press down on his shoulders.",

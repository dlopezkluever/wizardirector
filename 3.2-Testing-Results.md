## Testing steps from QUICK_START_GUIDE.md

### 1 : pass

### 2: Entered info; Got a pop up in bottom right saying: "Asset Created Successfully" However, no asset generated; additionally the console log gave this error: "Warning: Function components cannot be given refs. Attempts to access this ref will fail. Did you mean to use React.forwardRef()?

So the same thing happened in the UI; I entered the character description, submited, got the Asset Created Successfully message, but I see no image in the UI, nor in my backend storage/database. I wonder. Is the issue with this test being how our tables are made? 

Recall the only storage buckets we have for the asset-images is structured like follows:

📁 Folder structure:     
   asset-images/
     project_{projectId}/
       branch_{branchId}/
         master-assets/
         scene_{sceneId}/
           shot_{shotId}/

perhaps we need to reconsider how generated images/ assets are bieng stored? 

Or do you believe the issue is different

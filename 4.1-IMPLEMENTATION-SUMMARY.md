# Implementation Summary: Tasks 1-6.5 - Scene Extraction & API

## Date: 2026-01-25 (Updated: 2026-01-25 - Tasks 5, 6.5, 6, 7)

## Overview
Successfully implemented Tasks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.5, 6, and 7 from the Feature 4.1 implementation plan. These tasks enhance the scene extraction system with proper DAY/NIGHT detection, descriptive slug generation, robust scene boundary detection, backend API endpoints with ID stability, frontend service layer, and transactional gate approach for Stage 4/5 transition.

---

## ✅ Task 1: Align TypeScript Types with Database Schema

### File Modified: `src/types/scene.ts`

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated `SceneStatus` type** to match database enum values:
   - Changed `'shot-list-locked'` → `'shot_list_ready'`
   - Changed `'frames-locked'` → `'frames_locked'`
   - Changed `'video-complete'` → `'video_complete'`
   - Added `'continuity_broken'`

2. **Enhanced `Scene` interface** to align with database schema:
   - Added `scriptExcerpt: string` field (maps to database `script_excerpt`)
   - Updated `header` with comment: "Derived from scriptExcerpt (first line)"
   - Updated `openingAction` with comment: "Derived from scriptExcerpt (lines after header)"
   - Added comments for future enhancements on `expectedCharacters` and `expectedLocation`

### Type Alignment Matrix:

| Database Field | TypeScript Field | Transformation |
|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| `scene_number` | `sceneNumber` | Direct mapping |
| `slug` | `slug` | Direct mapping |
| `script_excerpt` | `scriptExcerpt` | Direct mapping |
| `status` | `status` | Direct mapping (after type update) |
| `script_excerpt` (first line) | `header` | Extract from `scriptExcerpt` |
| `script_excerpt` (after header) | `openingAction` | Extract from `scriptExcerpt` |

---

## ✅ Task 2: Enhance Scene Heading Parser

### File Modified: `src/lib/services/scriptService.ts`

### New Interface Added:

```typescript
interface ParsedHeading {
  type: 'INT' | 'EXT';
  location: string;
  timeOfDay?: string;
  fullHeading: string;
}
```

### New Method: `parseSceneHeading()`

**Purpose:** Parse scene headings to extract INT/EXT, location, and time of day.

**Regex Pattern:**
```regex
/^(INT\.|EXT\.)\s+(.+?)(?:\s*-\s*(DAY|NIGHT|CONTINUOUS|LATER|MOMENTS LATER|DAWN|DUSK|MORNING|AFTERNOON|EVENING))?$/i
```

**Supported Time Variations:**
- DAY
- NIGHT
- CONTINUOUS
- LATER
- MOMENTS LATER
- DAWN
- DUSK
- MORNING
- AFTERNOON
- EVENING

**Example Parsing:**

| Input | Type | Location | Time of Day |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `INT. KITCHEN - DAY` | INT | KITCHEN | DAY |
| `EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT` | EXT | CITY STREET | NIGHT |
| `INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS` | INT | ABANDONED WAREHOUSE | CONTINUOUS |
| `EXT. PARK - DAWN` | EXT | PARK | DAWN |
| `INT. BEDROOM` | INT | BEDROOM | undefined |

## ✅ Task 3: Improve Slug Generation with Uniqueness Guarantee

### File Modified: `src/lib/services/scriptService.ts`

### Implementation Date: 2026-01-25 (Refinement Session)

### Changes Made:

1. **Removed Redundant Duplicate Tracking Logic**
   - Previous implementation had unnecessary duplicate slug tracking that would never trigger (since scene numbers already ensure uniqueness)
   - Removed `slugCounts` Map and duplicate suffix logic from `extractScenes()` method
   - Simplified slug generation to use scene number directly for uniqueness

2. **Enhanced Time-of-Day Sanitization**
   - Fixed multi-word time-of-day values (e.g., "MOMENTS LATER") to properly sanitize spaces to hyphens
   - Added explicit sanitization: `replace(/\s+/g, '-')` for time-of-day values
   - Example: `"MOMENTS LATER"` → `"moments-later"` in slug

3. **Improved Documentation**
   - Added comprehensive JSDoc comments explaining slug format and examples
   - Clarified that scene number ensures uniqueness even for duplicate locations
   - Documented sanitization process for both location and time-of-day

### Method: `generateSlugFromParsedHeading()`

**Purpose:** Generate descriptive, unique slugs from parsed heading components.

**Slug Format:**
- With time: `{type}-{location}-{timeOfDay}-{sceneNumber}`
- Without time: `{type}-{location}-{sceneNumber}`

**Slug Sanitization:**
- **Location:** Converts to lowercase, removes special characters, replaces spaces with hyphens, collapses multiple hyphens
- **Time of Day:** Converts to lowercase, replaces spaces with hyphens (handles multi-word values like "MOMENTS LATER"), collapses multiple hyphens
- **Scene Number:** Included directly in slug for guaranteed uniqueness

**Uniqueness Guarantee:**
- Scene number included in slug ensures uniqueness
- No duplicate tracking needed (scene numbers are sequential and unique)
- Same location appearing multiple times gets different scene numbers: `int-kitchen-day-1`, `int-kitchen-day-5`

**Example Slugs:**

| Scene Heading | Scene # | Generated Slug |
|---------------|---------|----------------|
| `INT. KITCHEN - DAY` | 1 | `int-kitchen-day-1` |
| `EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT` | 2 | `ext-city-street-night-2` |
| `INT. KITCHEN - DAY` | 5 | `int-kitchen-day-5` |
| `INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER` | 3 | `int-office-moments-later-3` |
| `INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - DAY` | 4 | `int-johns-apartment-day-4` |

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Before: Had redundant duplicate tracking
const slugCounts = new Map<string, number>();
const baseSlug = this.generateSlugFromParsedHeading(parsedHeading, sceneNumber);
const slugCount = slugCounts.get(baseSlug) || 0;
slugCounts.set(baseSlug, slugCount + 1);
const uniqueSlug = slugCount > 0 ? `${baseSlug}-${slugCount + 1}` : baseSlug;

// After: Direct slug generation (scene number already ensures uniqueness)
const slug = this.generateSlugFromParsedHeading(parsedHeading, sceneNumber);
```

**Time-of-Day Sanitization Enhancement:**
```typescript
// Enhanced to handle multi-word time values
const timeOfDay = parsed.timeOfDay
  ? parsed.timeOfDay
      .toLowerCase()
      .replace(/\s+/g, '-')  // Handles "MOMENTS LATER" → "moments-later"
      .replace(/-+/g, '-')
      .trim()
  : undefined;
```

## ✅ Task 4: Enhance Scene Extraction Logic

### File Modified: `src/lib/services/scriptService.ts`

### Enhanced Method: `extractScenes()`

**Key Improvements:**

1. **Robust Scene Boundary Detection**
   - Uses `parseSceneHeading()` for accurate heading detection
   - Handles extra whitespace and formatting variations
   - Preserves original line formatting (including empty lines)

2. **Sequential Scene Numbering**
   - Scenes numbered sequentially: 1, 2, 3...
   - Scene number included in slug for uniqueness guarantee

3. **Content Validation**
   - Validates scenes have non-empty content before adding
   - Logs warnings for empty or malformed scenes
   - Handles edge cases gracefully

4. **Edge Case Handling**
   - Scripts with no scene headings
   - Scene headings without content
   - Multiple consecutive scene headings
   - Empty scripts
   - Final scene in script (proper boundary detection)

**Note:** Slug generation logic moved to Task 3 (see above). The `generateSlugFromParsedHeading()` method is used by `extractScenes()` to create unique, descriptive slugs.

## Testing Results

### Test Files Created:
- `src/lib/services/__tests__/scriptService.test.ts` - Comprehensive Vitest test suite
- `TESTING-SLUG-GENERATION.md` - Testing guide with multiple methods
- `test-slug-generation.js` - Reference script with expected outputs

### Test Coverage:
- ✅ Scene numbering (sequential 1, 2, 3...)
- ✅ Slug includes scene number for uniqueness
- ✅ DAY/NIGHT/CONTINUOUS parsing
- ✅ Slug uniqueness (no duplicates)
- ✅ Duplicate location handling (same location at different times)
- ✅ Multi-word time-of-day sanitization (MOMENTS LATER → moments-later)
- ✅ Special character sanitization (JOHN'S → johns)
- ✅ Content extraction (full scene text including heading)

### Real API Response (Verified):
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "sceneCount": 20,
  "scenes": [
    {
      "id": "780bc0e4-67ae-4718-adc6-d923c83f6fdb",
      "scene_number": 1,
      "slug": "ext-city-streets-evening-1"
    },
    {
      "id": "b16c62f0-0100-4c90-aaf3-88d6c1ed240b",
      "scene_number": 2,
      "slug": "int-mr-sterlings-luxury-sedan-night-2"
    },
    {
      "id": "c1252ff1-df96-426e-880d-49d17ce69943",
      "scene_number": 3,
      "slug": "int-ms-thornes-luxury-sedan-night-3"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ All slugs follow format: `{type}-{location}-{timeOfDay}-{sceneNumber}`
- ✅ Special characters sanitized: "MR. STERLING'S" → "mr-sterlings"
- ✅ Multi-word locations handled: "CITY STREETS" → "city-streets"
- ✅ Scene numbers ensure uniqueness

✅ GET endpoint fetches scenes correctly with proper transformations
✅ PUT endpoint preserves scene IDs when slugs match
✅ Deleted scenes marked as `continuity_broken` to prevent orphaning
✅ Frontend service layer provides clean abstraction for scene operations
✅ Preview functionality works without persistence

---

## ✅ Task 5: Create Scene Fetching API Endpoint

### File Modified: `backend/src/routes/projects.ts`

### New Endpoint: `GET /api/projects/:id/scenes`

**Purpose:** Fetch all scenes for a project's active branch for Stage 6 Script Hub.

**Implementation:**
- Validates project ownership and active branch
- Queries scenes table ordered by `scene_number`
- Transforms database format to frontend `Scene` interface
- Extracts `header` (first line) and `openingAction` (remaining lines) from `script_excerpt`

**Response Format:**
```typescript
{
  scenes: Array<{
    id: string;
    sceneNumber: number;
    slug: string;
    status: SceneStatus;
    scriptExcerpt: string;
    header: string;        // First line of script_excerpt
    openingAction: string; // Lines after header
    // ... other fields
  }>
}
```

---

## ✅ Task 6.5: Implement Scene ID Stability (Diff & Match Logic)

### File Modified: `backend/src/routes/projects.ts`

### Enhanced Endpoint: `PUT /api/projects/:id/scenes`

**Purpose:** Preserve existing scene IDs when slugs match to avoid orphaning downstream work (Stages 6-12).

**Implementation:**
1. **Fetch existing scenes** for the active branch before inserting
2. **Match by slug + scene_number:**
   - If match found: preserve existing `scene_id` and update only `script_excerpt`
   - If no match: create new scene with new UUID
3. **Handle deleted scenes:**
   - Log warnings about removed scenes
   - Mark as `'continuity_broken'` status to warn about downstream impact
4. **Return ID mapping** for debugging/logging

**Key Features:**
- Prevents orphaning shot lists, frames, and videos when scenes are re-extracted
- Updates only `script_excerpt` for matched scenes (preserves status and other fields)
- Tracks deleted scenes without physically removing them from database

**Response Format:**
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  sceneCount: number,
  scenes: Array<{ id, scene_number, slug }>,
  idMapping: Array<{ oldId?, newId, slug, sceneNumber }>,
  deletedScenesCount: number
}
```

## ✅ Task 6: Create Scene Service in Frontend

### File Created: `src/lib/services/sceneService.ts`

### Methods Implemented:

1. **`fetchScenes(projectId: string): Promise<Scene[]>`**
   - Fetches scenes from GET endpoint
   - Transforms API response to `Scene[]` format
   - Handles authentication

2. **`previewScenes(script: string): Promise<Scene[]>`**
   - In-memory scene extraction (no persistence)
   - Uses `scriptService.extractScenes()` for extraction
   - Transforms to `Scene[]` format with `header` and `openingAction`
   - Used for Stage 4 preview functionality

3. **`getScene(sceneId: string): Promise<Scene>`**
   - Placeholder (requires projectId; use `fetchScenes` and filter)

4. **`updateSceneStatus(sceneId: string, status: SceneStatus): Promise<void>`**
   - Placeholder for future endpoint implementation

**Key Features:**
- Centralized service for all scene operations
- Handles type transformations between internal and database formats
- Resolves type conflicts between scriptService's internal `Scene` and database `Scene` types

---

## ✅ Task 7: Stage 4/5 Transition Logic (Gate Approach)

### File Modified: `src/components/pipeline/Stage4MasterScript.tsx`

### Implementation Date: 2026-01-25

**Purpose:** Implement transactional gate approach for scene extraction. Scene extraction only commits to database when transitioning from Stage 4 to Stage 5, preventing constant "Deterministic Invalidation" triggers.

### Phase A: Draft Phase (Preview)

**Features:**
- **"Preview Scenes" Button:** Allows users to preview extracted scenes without committing
- Uses `sceneService.previewScenes()` for in-memory extraction
- Displays scene count and list in dialog modal
- Optionally saves preview to `stage_states.content.scenes` JSONB for persistence
- **Does NOT** write to `scenes` table

**UI Components:**
- Preview button in header with loading state
- Dialog modal showing scene list with number, header, slug, and preview text

### Phase B: Commit Phase (Approve Script)

**Enhanced `handleApproveScript` Function:**
1. **Scene Validation:**
   - Validates script is not empty
   - Ensures at least one scene is extracted
   - Validates all scenes have non-empty content

2. **Downstream Data Check:**
   - Checks if Stage 4 is already locked
   - Detects Phase B data (scenes with status `shot_list_ready`, `frames_locked`, or `video_complete`)
   - Shows warning modal if downstream data exists

3. **Approval Flow:**
   - Extracts scenes from current script content
   - Persists via `scriptService.persistScenes()` (backend applies Scene ID Stability)
   - Locks Stage 4
   - Shows success toast with scene count
   - Navigates to Stage 5

**Downstream Impact Warning:**
- Modal appears when Stage 4 is locked and Phase B data exists
- Explains potential impact (scene ID changes, continuity breaks)
- Allows user to proceed with awareness
- **Note:** Simplified version (no forced branching; branching deferred to Phase 10)

### Key Implementation Details

- **Gate Approach:** Scene extraction is transactional - only commits on Stage 4→5 transition
- **Preview Persistence:** Preview scenes saved to JSONB for page refresh persistence
- **Error Handling:** User-friendly error messages for validation failures
- **Scene ID Stability:** Backend automatically preserves existing scene IDs (Task 6.5)

### Files Modified

1. **src/components/pipeline/Stage4MasterScript.tsx**
   - Added preview scenes functionality
   - Enhanced approve script with validation and downstream checks
   - Added preview dialog and downstream warning modal
   - Fixed function declaration order (proceedWithApproval before handleApproveScript)

---

## Next Steps (Remaining Tasks from Plan)

- **Task 8:** Replace Mock Data in Stage 6
- **Task 9:** Add Scene Extraction Tests
